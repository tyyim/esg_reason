# Baseline Comparison: Dev Set vs Full Dataset

## üìä Apples-to-Apples Comparison

**RAG Module**: BaselineMMESGBenchRAG (no query optimization)
**Evaluation**: Fixed retrieval metrics (post-bug-fix)

| Dataset | Questions | Accuracy | Correct | Notes |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Full Dataset** | 933 | 39.9% | 372/933 | Previous evaluation |
| **Dev Set** | 93 | 38.7% | 36/93 | Current evaluation |

**Conclusion**: ‚úÖ **Consistent performance** - Dev set (38.7%) aligns with full dataset (39.9%). No regression, this is the real baseline.

## üîç Performance Breakdown (Dev Set with Fixed Metrics)

### Overall
- **Retrieval**: 75.3% (70/93) ‚Üê Real metric, not fake 100%
- **Answer**: 49.5% (46/93) ‚Üê Bottleneck
- **End-to-end**: 38.7% (36/93) ‚Üê Matches full dataset

### By Format
- **Str**: 61.8% retrieval, 58.8% answer, 41.2% E2E
- **Float**: 76.9% retrieval, 61.5% answer, 53.8% E2E
- **List**: 76.9% retrieval, 53.8% answer, 38.5% E2E
- **Int**: 78.9% retrieval, 57.9% answer, 52.6% E2E
- **None**: 100% retrieval, 0% answer ‚Üê Edge case

## üí° Key Insights

### 1. Retrieval is Good, Not Perfect
- 75.3% retrieval means 24.7% questions fail to retrieve correct evidence
- Still room for improvement, but not the 90% bottleneck we hypothesized

### 2. Answer Extraction is the Bigger Bottleneck
- Even when retrieval succeeds (70 questions), answer accuracy is ~52% (36/70 from E2E)
- This suggests prompt optimization should focus on reasoning + extraction

### 3. Both Matter for End-to-End Performance
- **Retrieval failures**: 23/93 questions (24.7%)
- **Answer failures (when retrieval works)**: ~34/70 questions (48.6%)
- **Both need optimization** for best results

## üéØ Optimization Strategy (Option C Validated ‚Üí Proceed with Full Optimization)

### Recommended: End-to-End MIPROv2 Optimization

**Approach**: Optimize all 3 components simultaneously
1. Query Generation (improve 75.3% ‚Üí 80-85% retrieval)
2. ESG Reasoning (improve analysis quality)
3. Answer Extraction (improve 49.5% ‚Üí 55-60% answer accuracy)

**Rationale**:
- Both retrieval AND reasoning contribute to failures
- MIPROv2 can optimize all components together
- End-to-end metric captures true performance

**Expected Improvement**:
- Retrieval: +5-10% (75.3% ‚Üí 80-85%)
- Answer: +5-10% (49.5% ‚Üí 55-60%)
- **End-to-end: +5-12% (38.7% ‚Üí 43-50%)**

**Time**: ~45-90 minutes

## üìã Previous Confusion Resolved

**The "45.1% (421/933)" reference** in `dspy_dataset.py` was:
- A hardcoded reference number, not actual results
- Actual full dataset baseline: 39.9% (372/933)
- Our dev set: 38.7% (36/93) is consistent ‚úÖ

**The "100% retrieval" in previous Phase 1a run** was:
- A critical bug in retrieval metric (returned 1.0 by default)
- Now fixed to correctly return 0.0 for failures
- True retrieval: 75.3%, not 100%

## ‚úÖ Validation Complete - Ready for Optimization

We have validated that:
1. ‚úÖ Dev set performance (38.7%) matches full dataset (39.9%)
2. ‚úÖ Fixed retrieval metric shows true performance (75.3%)
3. ‚úÖ Both retrieval AND answer extraction need improvement
4. ‚úÖ End-to-end optimization is the right approach

**Next Step**: Run enhanced MIPROv2 optimization with fixed metrics to optimize all 3 components (query + reasoning + extraction).
