# How to Enforce Workflow with Claude

This guide is for YOU (the human) to ensure Claude follows the workflow.

---

## üö® The Problem

Claude doesn't automatically remember to:
- Read CLAUDE.md
- Follow WORKFLOW.md
- Update documentation
- Check for past mistakes

**YOU need to enforce it at the start of each session.**

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Session Startup Protocol

### At the START of EVERY new session/conversation:

**Copy and paste this exact message to Claude:**

```
Before we do anything else, please follow the startup protocol:

1. Read and summarize:
   - CLAUDE.md (current focus)
   - Last 50 lines of CHANGELOG.md (recent work)
   - PRE_FLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md (if mid-task)

2. Tell me:
   - What is our current task?
   - What did we do last time?
   - What bugs have we recently fixed?
   - What should we do next?

3. Wait for my confirmation before proceeding.

Refer to .claude/START_SESSION.md for full protocol.
```

## üîÑ Mid-Session Reminders

If Claude is about to run something without verification:

```
STOP - Before running, complete the verification checklist from WORKFLOW.md:

- [ ] Correct dataset?
- [ ] Right evaluation set (train/dev/test)?
- [ ] Metadata matches what we're actually doing?
- [ ] Comparing apples to apples?
- [ ] Have we made this mistake before? (Check CHANGELOG)

Show me the checklist before proceeding.
```

## ‚úÖ Session End Protocol

Before ending the session:

```
Before we end:

1. Update CHANGELOG.md with what we did today
2. Update CLAUDE.md if status changed
3. Update PRE_FLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md if mid-task
4. Clean up any debug files
5. Show me what needs to be done next time

Follow the session end protocol in .claude/START_SESSION.md
```

## üìã Quick Reference Commands

Save these for easy copy-paste:

### Startup
```
Follow startup protocol in .claude/START_SESSION.md
```

### Before Running Anything
```
Complete pre-flight checklist from WORKFLOW.md before running
```

### After Completing Work
```
Update CHANGELOG.md and CLAUDE.md with what we just did
```

### Found a Bug
```
Document this bug in CHANGELOG.md immediately, and check if we've seen it before
```

---

## üéØ Making It Easier

### Option 1: Add to Custom Instructions

If Claude Code supports custom instructions, add this:

```
At the start of each session:
1. Read CLAUDE.md to understand current status
2. Read last 50 lines of CHANGELOG.md to see recent work
3. Summarize and wait for confirmation before proceeding

Before running any code:
1. Complete verification checklist from WORKFLOW.md
2. Check CHANGELOG.md for similar past mistakes
3. Show me the checklist before proceeding

After completing work:
1. Update CHANGELOG.md immediately
2. Update CLAUDE.md if status changed
3. Follow session end protocol
```

### Option 2: Create an Alias

Add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias claude-start="cat CLAUDE.md && echo '---' && tail -50 CHANGELOG.md"
```

Then run `claude-start` before starting each session and share the output with Claude.

---

## üö´ What NOT to Do

**Don't trust Claude to remember** - Claude has no memory between sessions

**Don't skip the startup protocol** - "Just this once" becomes "every time"

**Don't let Claude run without verification** - Mistakes compound quickly

**Don't forget to update docs** - Future you will thank present you

---

## ‚úÖ Success Looks Like

1. **Every session starts** with Claude reading CLAUDE.md and CHANGELOG.md
2. **Every task begins** with documentation and verification
3. **Every run includes** pre-flight checklist review
4. **Every completion** updates CHANGELOG.md and CLAUDE.md
5. **No repeated mistakes** because we check CHANGELOG first

---

## üéØ Your Responsibility

As the human, YOU must:

1. ‚úÖ Send startup protocol message at beginning of session
2. ‚úÖ Stop Claude if it skips verification
3. ‚úÖ Remind Claude to update docs after completing work
4. ‚úÖ Review the checklist when Claude shows it to you
5. ‚úÖ Enforce the session end protocol

**This is not automated - you need to actively enforce it.**

---

## üìù Session Template

Here's a full template for a complete session:

```
# SESSION START
Follow startup protocol in .claude/START_SESSION.md

[Claude reads docs and summarizes]

# CONFIRM OR CORRECT
[You verify Claude understood correctly]

# DO WORK
[With verification checklist at each step]

# SESSION END
Follow session end protocol in .claude/START_SESSION.md

[Claude updates docs and shows next steps]
```

## üí° Pro Tip

Keep this file open in a browser tab so you can quickly copy-paste the enforcement messages.

**Remember: The workflow only works if YOU enforce it!**
