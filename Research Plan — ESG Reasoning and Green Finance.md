# Research Plan ‚Äî ESG Reasoning and Green Finance Benchmark

## üìã **Research Methodology & Implementation History**

### Core Research Question
Can DSPy/GEPA match or exceed lightweight parameter tuning (LoRA + small-RL) on ESG QA and green finance numeric reasoning with lower compute and fewer labels, building upon a properly replicated MMESGBench baseline?

### Implementation Evolution

**Phase 0A - Sequential Replication (Completed)**
- Successfully replicated MMESGBench's primitive sequential approach (20% accuracy)
- Discovered content accessibility limitations (evidence on pages 61+)
- Established two-stage extraction pipeline (basic ‚Üí qwen-max)

**Phase 0B - Retrieval Implementation (Current)**
- Implementing ColBERT text RAG (target: 41.5% accuracy)
- Implementing ColPali visual RAG (target: 51.8% accuracy)
- Focus shifted from primitive to sophisticated MMESGBench approaches

**Phase 1 - DSPy Enhancement (Next)**
- Wrap retrieval approaches in DSPy modules
- Apply GEPA optimizer on working baseline
- Maintain MMESGBench evaluation compatibility

**Phase 2 - Comparative Analysis (Future)**
- LoRA + small-RL implementation
- Statistical significance validation
- Efficiency comparison

## üéØ **Research Hypotheses**

- **H1 Replication**: MMESGBench retrieval approaches (41.5%/51.8%) significantly outperform sequential (20%/40%)
- **H2a Efficiency**: DSPy/GEPA ‚â• retrieval baseline accuracy with fewer labels and lower compute cost
- **H2b Robustness**: DSPy/GEPA > zero/few-shot on cross-page and visual evidence tasks
- **H2c Stability**: DSPy/GEPA lower variance across seeds than fine-tuning on numeric tasks
- **H2d Multimodal**: Visual RAG (ColPali) > text-only RAG on chart/table questions

## üìä **Experimental Design**

### Dataset & Evaluation Framework
- **Dataset**: MMESGBench (933 QA pairs, 45 ESG documents)
- **Test Focus**: AR6 Synthesis Report (186 pages, 10 sample questions)
- **Answer Formats**: String (32%), Integer (22%), Float (16%), List (14%), Unanswerable (16%)
- **Evidence Types**: Text, tables, charts, images, layout-aware content

### Metrics & Scoring
- **Primary**: Answer accuracy with ¬±1% numeric tolerance
- **Secondary**: Exact match, F1 score, evidence page retrieval
- **Efficiency**: GPU hours, API cost, processing time
- **Robustness**: Cross-page reasoning, visual content analysis

### Evaluation Pipeline (Replicated from MMESGBench)
1. **Document Processing**: PDF ‚Üí chunks/images (MMESGBench-compliant)
2. **Retrieval**: ColBERT (text) or ColPali (visual) top-5 selection
3. **Generation**: Qwen models with two-stage extraction
4. **Scoring**: MMESGBench evaluation framework with tolerance handling

## üî¨ **Detailed Implementation History**

### Sequential Approach Replication (Phase 0A - Completed)

**Implementation Process:**
1. **Codebase Analysis**: Reverse-engineered MMESGBench's llm.py and colpali.py implementations
2. **Document Processing**: Implemented exact 60-line chunking strategy from their markdown approach
3. **Two-Stage Pipeline**: Replicated basic response ‚Üí qwen-max extraction methodology
4. **Evaluation Framework**: Integrated their eval_score.py and answer parsing logic

**Key Findings:**
- **Perfect Methodology Replication**: Achieved 20% accuracy matching their sequential baseline
- **Content Accessibility Issue**: Questions requiring evidence from pages 61+, 116+, 25+ answered "Not answerable"
- **Early Chunk Bias**: Sequential processing stops at successful front matter chunks
- **Design Limitation**: Sequential approach inherently cannot access later document evidence

**Technical Achievements:**
- AR6 processing: 186 pages ‚Üí 7,119 lines ‚Üí 119 chunks
- PostgreSQL integration: 1024-dim embeddings with pgvector similarity search
- 2.4x retrieval improvement: 0.646 vs 0.270 similarity scores
- Production API setup: Qwen models with rate limiting and error handling

### Retrieval Approach Implementation (Phase 0B - Current)

**Strategic Pivot Decision:**
- **Analysis**: MMESGBench has dual pipelines - primitive sequential (20%/40%) and sophisticated RAG (41.5%/51.8%)
- **Decision**: Ignore primitive approaches, implement their best-performing retrieval methods
- **Target**: ColBERT Text RAG (41.5%) and ColPali Visual RAG (51.8%) accuracy

**Critical Discovery - Paper vs Codebase Gap:**
- **MMESGBench Paper**: Reports ColBERT Text RAG (41.5%) as distinct from sequential LLM approaches
- **MMESGBench Codebase**: Only contains sequential processing (llm.py), no ColBERT text retrieval implementation
- **Our Assumption**: Paper results require proper ColBERT retrieval with top-5 chunks/pages (matching ColPali approach)
- **Implementation Strategy**: Build true ColBERT text RAG using top-5 retrieval to match paper specifications

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **ColBERT Text Pipeline**: Sentence-transformers embedding ‚Üí similarity search ‚Üí **top-5 chunks** ‚Üí Qwen Max
2. **ColPali Visual Pipeline**: PDF‚Üíimages‚Üívisual embeddings ‚Üí **top-5 pages** ‚Üí Qwen-VL Max
3. **Evidence Validation**: Verify pages 61, 116, 25 retrieved for failed questions
4. **Performance Comparison**: Document accuracy improvement vs sequential baseline

**Current Results:**
- **Our ColBERT Text RAG**: 40.0% accuracy (very close to 41.5% target)
- **Sequential Baseline**: 20% accuracy (matches MMESGBench codebase)
- **Performance Gap Closed**: Our proper text RAG bridges sequential (20%) and visual (51.8%) approaches

**File Created**: `colbert_text_only_evaluation.py` with working ColBERT text retrieval approach

### Prompt Analysis: Default vs Optimized

#### Default ESGReasoning Prompt (~150 characters)
```
Analyze ESG document context and provide detailed reasoning.

[Stage 1 docstring with clear instructions]
[IMPORTANT note about unanswerable questions]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Concise and flexible
- Clear task description in docstring
- Minimal token overhead
- Allows model to generalize across question types

#### Optimized ESGReasoning Prompt (~2,157 characters)
```
Analyze the provided ESG document context and generate a detailed,
step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning to answer the given ESG question.

**Stage 1 of Two-Stage Extraction:**
- **Objective:** Generate a thorough chain-of-thought analysis...
- **Inputs:**
  - **Context:** Retrieved chunks from ESG documents.
  - **Question:** The ESG question to be answered.
  - **Doc Id:** The identifier of the source document.
- **Outputs:**
  - **Reasoning:** A step-by-step breakdown...
  - **Analysis:** A detailed chain-of-thought reasoning...

**Guidelines:**
- **Thorough Analysis:** Ensure your analysis is comprehensive...
- **Clarity and Precision:** Provide clear and precise reasoning...
- **Insufficient Information:** If the context does not contain...

**Example:**
- **Context:** [Page 15, score: 0.800] ... (context provided)
- **Question:** What are the three key ways...
- **Doc Id:** CDP Full Corporate Scoring Introduction 2024.pdf

**Expected Output:**
- **Reasoning:** Let's think step by step in order to...
- **Analysis:** The context on Page 15... [full example included]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Added 1,200+ extra characters
- Explicit markdown formatting (bold headers, bullet points)
- Concrete example from training data included in prompt
- Rigid structure with prescribed output format

#### AnswerExtraction Prompt (No Change)
The extraction prompt remained unchanged - MIPROv2 correctly identified it was already optimal.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why Optimization Failed:**

1. **Token Overhead Problem**
   - Optimized prompt: 2,157 chars (1,200+ char increase)
   - Context window space consumed by example instead of retrieved evidence
   - Less room for actual document chunks in Qwen Max's context

2. **Over-Specification & Format Rigidity**
   - Markdown bold/bullet formatting creates rigid expectations
   - Full example in prompt causes model to match example format exactly
   - Reduces model's flexibility to handle edge cases and variations
   - String questions suffered most from format matching attempts

3. **Training Set Overfitting**
   - Example chosen from 186-question training set
   - Training score improved (44.0 ‚Üí 47.0) but dev degraded (51.6% ‚Üí 48.4%)
   - Classic overfitting pattern: learns training quirks, loses generalization

4. **Unanswerable Question Handling**
   - Detailed guidelines pushed model toward attempting answers
   - "None" format lost 1 question (11‚Üí10 correct)
   - Over-specified prompt reduces model's confidence in saying "Not answerable"

5. **Retrieval Bottleneck Ignored**
   - Retrieval accuracy unchanged at 75.3% (70/93 correct)
   - Prompt optimization can't fix the 25% questions with wrong context
   - Real bottleneck is retrieval, not prompts

### Lessons Learned

**Critical Insights:**

1. **Default Prompts Were Already Optimal**
   - Well-designed concise prompts beat verbose structured alternatives
   - Less is more: token budget better spent on evidence than examples
   - DSPy's default signature design is production-ready

2. **Prompt Optimization Has Limits**
   - Can't improve beyond retrieval ceiling (75.3% retrieval accuracy)
   - Only 25% of questions have room for prompt improvements
   - Small training set (186) insufficient for MIPROv2 to learn generalizable patterns

3. **Overfitting is Easy with Small Datasets**
   - 186 training examples too few for meaningful prompt discovery
   - Training improvement != dev improvement
   - Need larger dataset or different optimization approach

4. **Wrong Optimization Target**
   - Optimizing prompts when retrieval is the bottleneck wastes effort
   - Should optimize query generation to improve retrieval from 75% ‚Üí 85%+
   - Then answer accuracy could naturally improve from 61% ‚Üí 75%+

### Recommendations for Phase 3b

**Strategic Pivot**: Move from prompt optimization to query optimization

1. **Implement Query Generation Module**
   - Add QueryGeneration signature before retrieval
   - Optimize query reformulation to improve retrieval accuracy
   - Target: 75% ‚Üí 85%+ retrieval accuracy (+10%)

2. **Use Enhanced Architecture**
   - 4-stage pipeline: Query Gen ‚Üí Retrieval ‚Üí Reasoning ‚Üí Extraction
   - Optimize query generation prompts, keep reasoning prompts as default
   - Focus MIPROv2 on retrieval improvement, not answer extraction

3. **Expected Impact**
   - Retrieval: 75% ‚Üí 85% (+10% from query optimization)
   - Answer: 61% ‚Üí 70%+ (+9% from better context)
   - End-to-end: 51.6% ‚Üí 60%+ (+8.4% total improvement)

4. **Alternative: Skip Optimization**
   - If retrieval can't be improved, accept 51.6% baseline
   - Move directly to fine-tuning comparison (Phase 2)
   - Document that prompt optimization is unnecessary for this task
