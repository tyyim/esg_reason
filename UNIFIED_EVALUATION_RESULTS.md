### Predictions with Full Retrieval Information

| Prediction Set | Dataset | Retrieval | Answer | E2E | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Optimized** | 93 dev | **71.0%** (66/93) | **51.6%** (48/93) | **43.0%** (40/93) | ‚úÖ Has context field |

### Predictions WITHOUT Retrieval Information

| Prediction Set | Dataset | Retrieval | Answer | E2E | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DSPy Full** | 933 full | 16.1%* (150/933) | 40.5% (378/933) | 0.0%* (0/933) | ‚ö†Ô∏è No context field, can't verify retrieval |
| **Baseline Dev** | 93 dev | 15.1%* (14/93) | 45.2% (42/93) | 0.0%* (0/93) | ‚ö†Ô∏è No context field, extracted from full |
| **MIPROv2 Baseline** | 93 dev | N/A | N/A | N/A | ‚ùå File is empty (0 predictions) |

*Note: Low retrieval rates (15-16%) are due to missing retrieval information in the prediction files, NOT actual retrieval failures.

- **Total Questions**: 93
- **Retrieval Correct**: 66 (71.0%)
- **Answer Correct**: 48 (51.6%)
- **End-to-End Correct**: 40 (43.0%)

### By Format

| Format | Total | Retrieval Acc | Answer Acc | E2E Acc |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Float** | 13 | 69.2% (9/13) | 76.9% (10/13) | 61.5% (8/13) |
| **Int** | 19 | 78.9% (15/19) | 57.9% (11/19) | 52.6% (10/19) |

| **Str** | 34 | 52.9% (18/34) | 35.3% (12/34) | 23.5% (8/34) |
| **null** | 14 | 100.0% (14/14) | 71.4% (10/14) | 71.4% (10/14) |

### Key Insights

1. **Best Format**: Float (61.5% E2E) and Int (52.6% E2E)
2. **Worst Format**: Str (23.5% E2E) - retrieval is okay (52.9%) but answer extraction fails (35.3%)
3. **List Format**: Good retrieval (76.9%) but poor answer extraction (38.5%)
4. **Null Format**: Perfect retrieval (100%) and good answer (71.4%)

### Bottleneck Analysis

**Where does the model fail?**:

- **Retrieval failures**: 29.0% (27/93 questions) - Failed to retrieve correct evidence pages
- **Extraction failures**: 17.2% (16/93 questions) - Retrieved correct pages but extracted wrong answer
- **Both correct**: 43.0% (40/93 questions) - Both retrieval AND extraction succeeded

**Primary bottleneck**: Retrieval (29% failure rate) > Extraction (17% failure rate when retrieval succeeds)

## üî¨ Comparison with Historical Results

### Optimized Model (93 dev) - Different Evaluation Methods

| Evaluation Method | E2E Accuracy | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Strict matching** | 33.3% (31/93) | Original evaluation with exact string matching |
| **Relaxed matching** | 50.5% (47/93) | Manual semantic matching added |
| **MMESGBench unified** | **43.0% (40/93)** | ‚úÖ This evaluation - official MMESGBench logic |

**Key Discovery**: MMESGBench's fuzzy matching (ANLS threshold 0.5) is **between strict and relaxed**:
- More lenient than strict exact matching
- More conservative than our relaxed semantic matching

### DSPy Full Dataset (933 questions) - Answer Accuracy Only

| Metric | From Original File | From Unified Evaluator | Match? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Answer accuracy** | 45.7% (426/933) | 40.5% (378/933) | ‚ùå -5.2% difference |
| **E2E accuracy** | 37.3% (348/933) | 0.0%* (0/933) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't verify - no retrieval info |

*E2E can't be calculated because prediction file lacks retrieval information.

**Explanation of discrepancy**:
- Original file used DSPy's internal evaluation during runtime
- Unified evaluator only has access to prediction file without context
- 5.2% difference likely due to missing null/edge case handling

## üéØ Final Conclusions

### Question: "What is the optimized model's actual accuracy?"

**Answer**: **43.0% E2E accuracy (40/93 questions)** using MMESGBench's exact evaluation logic.

- This is **NOT 50.5%** (relaxed semantic matching was too lenient)
- This is **NOT 33.3%** (strict matching was too harsh)
- This is **the official MMESGBench standard** using ANLS fuzzy matching with 0.5 threshold

### Question: "Did optimization improve the model?"

**Answer**: **No, optimization degraded performance by -5.4%**:

- MIPROv2 Baseline: 48.4% E2E (from original file)
- Optimized: 43.0% E2E (unified evaluator)
- Change: **-5.4% degradation**

*Note: Can't verify baseline with unified evaluator due to missing retrieval info in prediction file*

### Question: "What caused the optimization failure?"

**Root causes**:
1. **Dataset mismatch**: valset ‚â† devset caused overfitting to train set
2. **Retrieval degradation**: 75.3% ‚Üí 71.0% (-4.3%)
3. **Extraction degradation**: 58.1% ‚Üí 51.6% (-6.5%)
4. **Compounding effect**: Both retrieval AND extraction got worse

## üîß Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Use unified evaluator for ALL future evaluations** to ensure consistency
2. **Always include retrieval information** (context field) in prediction files
3. **Re-run optimization with fixes**:
   - Set `valset=devset` to prevent overfitting
   - Use MMESGBench evaluation logic during optimization (not relaxed matching)
   - Add separate retrieval module optimization

### Code Updates

4. **Update all evaluation scripts** to save context/retrieval information
5. **Add MMESGBench's exact evaluation** to DSPy metrics (not just semantic matching)
6. **Create prediction file validator** to ensure all required fields are present
