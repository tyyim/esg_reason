# Two-Stage Agentic System: GEPA Reasoning → MIPROv2 Extraction

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Problem**: Format-based routing (+2.6%) doesn't leverage GEPA's domain expertise (23 unique wins)  
**Solution**: Two-stage system combining GEPA's reasoning with MIPROv2's extraction

---

## 🎯 The Problem with Simple Routing

### Current Best: Format-Based Routing (50.2%)

**Gains**:
- MIPROv2 better on Int/Float/Str: +18 questions
- Baseline better on List/Null: saves -17 questions loss
- **Total**: +17 questions = 50.2%

**Lost Opportunity**:
- **GEPA's 23 unique wins** - questions where ONLY GEPA succeeded
- These require domain expertise + deep reasoning
- Format routing misses these entirely!

### GEPA's Unique Value (23 Questions)

| Characteristic | Count | % |
|----------------|-------|---|
| **Qualitative reasoning** | 12 | 52% |
| **Quantitative reasoning** | 7 | 30% |
| **Domain-specific** | 6 | 26% |

**Example unique wins**:
- q22: Total base year emissions → needs carbon accounting knowledge
- q77: Economic impact calculation → needs financial reasoning
- q84: Parties count → needs contextual understanding
- q133: Centralized vs distributed → needs organizational reasoning

**These 23 questions show GEPA's strength: deep reasoning + domain knowledge!**

## 💡 The Two-Stage Solution

### Concept: Best of Both Worlds

**Stage 1: GEPA Reasoning**
- Use GEPA's verbose prompts + domain knowledge
- Generate detailed reasoning, context, and insights
- Extract key information and relationships

**Stage 2: MIPROv2 Extraction**
- Feed GEPA's reasoning + original context to MIPROv2
- MIPROv2 performs structured extraction
- Benefit: GEPA's understanding + MIPROv2's format reliability

### Why This Works

**GEPA's Strengths**:
- ✅ Domain expertise (31.7% of improvements)
- ✅ Deep reasoning on complex questions
- ✅ Qualitative understanding
- ❌ Poor structured output (List -5.7%, Null -3.7%)

**MIPROv2's Strengths**:
- ✅ Structured extraction (Int +6.6%, Float +1.0%, Str +3.3%)
- ✅ Reliable output formatting
- ✅ Consistent performance
- ❌ Less domain knowledge, simpler reasoning

**Combined**:
- GEPA provides understanding → MIPROv2 provides structure
- Capture GEPA's 23 unique wins
- Avoid GEPA's format issues
- Leverage MIPROv2's extraction reliability

### Triage Logic

**Route to Two-Stage if**:
1. **Domain detected**: carbon, emissions, ESG, SA8000, renewable, compliance, etc.
2. **Complex reasoning**: "explain", "describe", "why", "how does", "according to"
3. **Multi-step**: multiple clauses, conditional logic, comparisons
4. **Ambiguous**: requires contextual understanding

**Route to MIPROv2 only if**:
1. **Simple factual**: straightforward extraction
2. **Structured numeric**: basic calculations
3. **High confidence**: clear answer in context

**Route to Baseline if**:
1. **List questions**: avoid GEPA/MIPROv2 format issues
2. **Null questions**: simple refusal detection

### Expected Coverage

- **Two-Stage** (GEPA → MIPROv2): ~40% of questions (260/654)
- **MIPROv2 only**: ~30% of questions (200/654)
- **Baseline only**: ~30% of questions (194/654)

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Conservative Estimate (52-54%)

**Assumptions**:
- Two-stage captures 50% of GEPA's unique wins (12/23)
- Two-stage improves domain questions by +3%
- Rest same as format-based routing

**Calculation**:
- Format-based baseline: 328/654
- Add 12 GEPA unique wins: +12
- Add 8 domain improvements: +8
- **Total**: 348/654 = **53.2%**

### Optimistic Estimate (55-57%)

**Assumptions**:
- Two-stage captures 75% of GEPA's unique wins (17/23)
- Two-stage improves domain questions by +5%
- Some synergy from combined reasoning

**Calculation**:
- Format-based baseline: 328/654
- Add 17 GEPA unique wins: +17
- Add 15 domain improvements: +15
- **Total**: 360/654 = **55.0%**

### Target: **53-55% (+5-7% vs MIPROv2)**

**vs Current best**:
- vs MIPROv2 (47.6%): +5.4-7.4%
- vs Format-based (50.2%): +2.8-4.8%
- vs Oracle (58.7%): Still -3.7% gap (room for improvement)

## 💰 Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Compute Cost

**Format-Based** (baseline):
- All questions: 1× inference

## 💡 Alternative Agentic Strategies

### Strategy A: Cascading Confidence

**Concept**: Start simple, escalate if uncertain

**Flow**:
1. Try Baseline (fast, cheap)
2. If confidence < 0.7 → Try MIPROv2
3. If confidence < 0.7 OR domain → Try GEPA
4. Return first confident answer

**Pros**: Adaptive cost (only use expensive models when needed)  
**Cons**: Requires confidence calibration

### Strategy B: Weighted Expert Voting

**Concept**: All models vote, weighted by expertise

**Weights**:
- Int/Float: MIPROv2 = 2.0, GEPA = 1.0, Baseline = 1.0
- Str: MIPROv2 = 1.5, GEPA = 1.5, Baseline = 1.0
- List/null: Baseline = 2.0, others = 1.0
- Domain detected: GEPA × 1.5

**Pros**: No routing needed, leverages all models  
**Cons**: 3× cost, models too correlated (46.8% accuracy)

### Strategy C: Adaptive LLM Router

**Concept**: Train small LLM to predict best model

**Training**:
- Features: question text, length, domain, format, complexity
- Label: which model succeeded
- Model: Small classifier (qwen2.5-1.5b)

**Pros**: Learns optimal routing over time  
**Cons**: Requires training data, additional inference

### Why Two-Stage is Best

1. **Better than cascading**: Combines models rather than choosing
2. **Better than voting**: Synergy not just aggregation
3. **Better than learned router**: Interpretable rules, no training needed
4. **Expected performance**: 53-55% (best of all strategies)

| **Cost** | 1.0× | 1.4× | 1.1-1.5× | 3.0× | 1.2× |

- Still validates two-stage concept
- Iterate on triage logic

### Risk 2: Higher than Expected Cost (>1.5×)

**Mitigation**:
- Optimize triage to reduce two-stage usage
- Use confidence thresholds
- Cache GEPA reasoning for similar questions

### Risk 3: Implementation Complexity

**Mitigation**:
- Start with simple triage rules
- Incremental deployment
- Extensive testing on dev set first

### Risk 4: GEPA Reasoning Doesn't Transfer

**Mitigation**:
- Test reasoning quality manually
- A/B test with/without GEPA reasoning
- Fall back to MIPROv2 only if transfer fails
