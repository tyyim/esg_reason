        "answer": "scope 2",
        "analysis": "According to the context provided:\n1. **Organization C and D Relationship**: Organization C consumes 5 MWh of electricity from the T&D system and sells the remaining 95 MWh to Organization D. Since Organization D is an end user who consumes the purchased electricity, we focus on the relationship between these two organizations.\n2. **Scope 2 Reporting**: Appendix 94 D of the document explains that if an organization consumes purchased electricity, the emissions associated with that electricity are reported in scope 2. In this case, since Organization D is consuming the electricity (95 MWh), the emissions associated with the 95 MWh of electricity sold by Organization C should be reported by Organization D in scope 2.\n3. **Scope 1 Reporting**: Company A reports its direct emissions from power generation under scope 1, and Company B reports emissions from purchased electricity sold to a non-end user as optional information separately from the scopes. This implies that if an organization generates and distributes electricity, the emissions associated with transmission and distribution (T&D) losses are not reported under scope 2 if the organization owns or controls the T&D system. However, in our scenario, there is no indication that Organization C owns or controls the T&D system; it simply consumes and sells electricity.\n4. **Vertical Integration Scenario**: The context also mentions that if generation, transmission, and distribution systems are vertically integrated and owned or controlled by the same organization, the emissions associated with T&D losses are not reported under scope 2. This does not apply to our scenario since the two organizations are separate entities.\n\nGiven these points, the electricity sold by Organization C to Organization D is accounted for as follows:\n- **Organization C**: Reports its direct emissions from power generation under scope 1.\n- **Organization D**: Reports the emissions associated with the 95 MWh of electricity it consumes from Organization C under scope 2.\n\nTherefore, the electricity sold by one public organization to another is accounted for in scope 2 reporting by the organization that consumes the electricity.",

        "answer": "10.0",
        "analysis": "Let's denote the electricity consumed as \\( E \\) (in kWh) and the T&D losses as \\( L \\) (in kWh). The formula becomes:\n\\[ 0.66E = 0.6(E + L) \\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying the equation:\n\\[ 0.66E = 0.6E + 0.6L \\]\n\\[ 0.66E - 0.6E = 0.6L \\]\n\\[ 0.06E = 0.6L \\]\n\\[ L = \\frac{0.06E}{0.6} \\]\n\\[ L = 0.1E \\]\n\nThis means that the T&D losses are 10% of the electricity consumed. To express this as a percentage:\n\\[ \\frac{L}{E} \\times 100\\% = 0.1 \\times 100\\% = 10\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of T&D losses over electricity consumed is 10%.",

From the context, we know that the total points available for a Data Center project are 18 points under the Energy and Atmosphere (EA) category and 18 points under the Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) category.\n2. To reach LEED Gold, a project needs a minimum of 60 points across all categories.\n3. If a project scores full points in both 'Energy and Atmosphere' and 'Indoor Environmental Quality', it would have scored 18 + 18 = 36 points.\n4. Therefore, the remaining points needed to reach LEED Gold would be 60 - 36 = 24 points.\n\nThe analysis shows that the project would need 24 more points from other categories to achieve LEED Gold certification.",

Therefore, the two topics that only require discussion and analysis disclosures are:\n1. Fleet Fuel Management\n2.

It enables organizations to provide comprehensive responses to a question by focusing on the most complete and well-reported row.\n\nThe context also mentions that a combination of these approaches might be used depending on the specific requirements of the scoring methodology.
