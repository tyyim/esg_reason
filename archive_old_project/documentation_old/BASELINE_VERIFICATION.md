# Baseline Verification - Simple Truth

## Source of Truth: Notion Phase 0 History

From the official Notion page (fetched just now):

| Phase | Approach | Accuracy | Questions Correct | Total | Source File |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------------|-------|-------------|
| **0E** | ColBERT Baseline | **41.3%** | 385/933 | 933 | `optimized_colbert_evaluator_mmesgbench.py` |
| **0F** | DSPy Baseline | **45.1%** | 421/933 | 933 | `dspy_implementation/evaluate_full_dataset.py` |

**Improvement: +3.8%** (from 41.3% → 45.1%)

## Verification from Actual Files

### 1. ColBERT Baseline (41.3%)

**File**: `corrected_evaluation_results/colbert_corrected_evaluation.json`

```json
{
  "accuracy": 0.46808510638297873,  // This is on 47 questions only!
  "total_questions": 47,
  "total_score": 22.0
}
```

**ISSUE**: This file shows 46.8% on only 47 questions, NOT the full 933 dataset.

Need to find the actual full dataset ColBERT results showing 41.3% (385/933).

### 2. DSPy Baseline (45.1%)

**File**: `dspy_implementation/full_dataset_results/baseline_results_20251010_232606.json`

```json
{
  "approach": "Baseline RAG (No Query Opt)",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T04:16:37.991863",
  "dataset_size": 933,
  "overall_metrics": {
    "end_to_end_accuracy": 0.3729903536977492,  // 37.3% !!!
    "answer_accuracy": 0.4565916398713826,      // 45.7% !!!
    "end_to_end_correct": 348,
    "answer_correct": 426,
    "total": 933
  }
}
```

**FINDING**:
- End-to-end accuracy: **37.3%** (348/933)
- Answer accuracy: **45.7%** (426/933) ← This is closest to the 45.1% claim!

**Likely Explanation**: The "45.1%" in Notion refers to **answer_accuracy**, not end-to-end accuracy.

---

## What Do These Metrics Mean?

From the DSPy results file, there are THREE different accuracy metrics:

1. **Retrieval Accuracy**: 75.6% (705/933) - Did we retrieve the right evidence pages?
2. **Answer Accuracy**: 45.7% (426/933) - Did we extract the right answer (ignoring retrieval)?
3. **End-to-End Accuracy**: 37.3% (348/933) - Both retrieval AND answer correct

**Phase 0F "45.1%"** likely refers to **Answer Accuracy** (45.7% rounded down).

## Corrected Understanding

| Baseline | Retrieval Acc | Answer Acc | E2E Acc | What Notion Reports |
|----------|---------------|------------|---------|---------------------|
| **ColBERT (0E)** | Unknown | Unknown | **41.3%** | 41.3% |
| **DSPy (0F)** | 75.6% | **45.7%** | **37.3%** | 45.1% (answer acc) |

**Problem**: Notion is comparing:
- ColBERT **end-to-end accuracy** (41.3%)
- DSPy **answer accuracy** (45.7%)

These are NOT directly comparable!

## What About the "51.6%" Latest Baseline?

Looking at the MIPROv2 optimization baseline from Oct 12:

**File**: `baseline_rag_results_20251012_023850.json`

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T02:38:50.941304",
  "dev_results": {
    "retrieval_accuracy": 0.7526881720430108,    // 75.3%
    "answer_accuracy": 0.5806451612903226,       // 58.1%
    "end_to_end_accuracy": 0.4838709677419355,   // 48.4% ← This is the baseline!
    "end_to_end_correct": 45,
    "total": 93
  }
}
```

**The "51.6%"** the user mentioned likely means:
- MIPROv2 baseline: 48.4% strict matching (45/93)
- Plus ~3% from false negatives → **~51-52% with relaxed matching**

## Final Clear Summary

### Full Dataset (933 questions):

| Baseline | Metric Type | Accuracy | Correct | File |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|------|
| **ColBERT (0E)** | End-to-end | 41.3% | 385/933 | Unknown file location |
| **DSPy (0F)** | End-to-end | 37.3% | 348/933 | `baseline_results_20251010_232606.json` |
| **DSPy (0F)** | Answer only | 45.7% | 426/933 | Same file |

**Notion reports 45.1%** = Answer accuracy (not end-to-end)

### Dev Set (93 questions):

| Baseline | Metric Type | Accuracy | Correct | File |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|------|
| **Full Dataset DSPy** | End-to-end strict | 24.7% | 23/93 | Extracted from full dataset |
| **MIPROv2 Baseline** | End-to-end strict | 48.4% | 45/93 | `baseline_rag_results_20251012_023850.json` |
| **MIPROv2 Baseline** | End-to-end relaxed | ~51.6% | ~48/93 | Estimated |
| **Optimized** | End-to-end relaxed | 50.5% | 47/93 | `optimized_predictions.json` |

## Conclusion

**User's Confusion is Justified!**

The "45.1%" and "51.6%" are from DIFFERENT evaluation runs:
1. **45.1%** = DSPy full dataset answer accuracy (Oct 10)
2. **51.6%** = MIPROv2 dev set end-to-end with relaxed matching (Oct 12)

**They're comparing:**
- Different datasets (933 vs 93)
- Different metrics (answer accuracy vs end-to-end)
- Different evaluation runs (Oct 10 vs Oct 12)

**The Real Comparison Should Be:**

| Model | Dataset | Metric | Accuracy |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| DSPy Baseline (Oct 10) | 933 full | E2E | 37.3% |
| DSPy Baseline (Oct 10) | 93 dev | E2E | 24.7% |
| MIPROv2 Baseline (Oct 12) | 93 dev | E2E | 48.4% strict / ~51.6% relaxed |
| Optimized (Oct 12) | 93 dev | E2E | 33.3% strict / 50.5% relaxed |

**Root Cause**: MIPROv2 optimization used a MUCH BETTER baseline (48.4%) than the original DSPy baseline (24.7% on dev set), but optimization slightly hurt performance (-1.1% with relaxed matching).
