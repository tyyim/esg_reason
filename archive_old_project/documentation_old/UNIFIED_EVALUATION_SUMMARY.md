## üéØ Main Question Answered

**Q: What is the optimized model's real accuracy?**

**A: 43.0% E2E accuracy (40/93 questions)**

Using MMESGBench's exact `eval_score()` function with ANLS fuzzy matching (threshold 0.5):
- **Retrieval**: 71.0% (66/93)
- **Answer**: 51.6% (48/93)
- **End-to-End**: 43.0% (40/93)

## üìä Comparison Table

| Baseline | Dataset | Retrieval | Answer | E2E | Evaluation Method |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ColBERT (0E)** | 933 full | Unknown | Unknown | 41.3% | Historical |
| **DSPy (0F)** | 933 full | 75.6% | 45.7% | 37.3% | Original file (Oct 10) |
| **MIPROv2 Baseline** | 93 dev | 75.3% | 58.1% | 48.4% | Original file (Oct 12) |
| **Optimized** | 93 dev | 71.0% | 51.6% | **43.0%** | ‚úÖ Unified evaluator |

## üîç Key Discoveries

### 1. Optimization Failed by -5.4%

- **Baseline**: 48.4% E2E
- **Optimized**: 43.0% E2E
- **Change**: **-5.4% degradation**

### 2. Three Different Evaluation Methods Give Three Different Results

| Method | E2E Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Strict matching | 33.3% | Too harsh - exact string only |
| MMESGBench unified | **43.0%** | ‚úÖ Official standard (ANLS 0.5) |
| Relaxed matching | 50.5% | Too lenient - semantic similarity |

### 3. Both Retrieval AND Extraction Got Worse

- Retrieval: 75.3% ‚Üí 71.0% (-4.3%)
- Answer: 58.1% ‚Üí 51.6% (-6.5%)
- E2E: 48.4% ‚Üí 43.0% (-5.4%)

### 4. Format-Specific Performance

**Best formats**:
- Float: 61.5% E2E (10/13 correct)
- Int: 52.6% E2E (10/19 correct)
- null: 71.4% E2E (10/14 correct)

**Worst formats**:
- Str: 23.5% E2E (8/34 correct) ‚Üê **Main bottleneck**
- List: 30.8% E2E (4/13 correct)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Why Some Results Can't Be Verified

**DSPy Full Dataset (933 questions)**:
- Prediction file missing `context` field (no retrieval information)
- Can only verify answer accuracy: 40.5% (vs 45.7% reported)
- E2E accuracy from original file: 37.3% (can't re-verify)

**MIPROv2 Baseline (93 dev)**:
- File is empty (0 predictions loaded)
- Must trust original reported numbers: 48.4% E2E

### Only Verified Number with Full Data

**Optimized model (93 dev)**: 43.0% E2E ‚úÖ
- Has complete context field with retrieved page numbers
- Re-evaluated with MMESGBench's exact logic
- This is the ONLY number we can fully verify

## üîß What To Do Next

### Immediate Actions

1. **Accept that optimization failed** (-5.4% degradation, not improvement)
2. **Use unified evaluator** for all future evaluations
3. **Always save context field** in prediction files

### Re-run Optimization (Recommended)

**Fixes needed**:
```python
# In enhanced_miprov2_optimization.py
optimizer = MIPROv2(
    valset=devset,  # ‚Üê FIX: Prevent overfitting to trainset
    num_candidates=10,
    metric=mmesgbench_eval_score,  # ‚Üê FIX: Use official evaluation
    ...
)
```

Expected improvement: +3-8% over current baseline (48.4%)
