KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================
‚ö†Ô∏è  PRIMARY ISSUE: EXTRACTION (41 failures)
   - 41 questions failed at extraction stage
   - 23 questions failed at retrieval stage
   - Extraction accounts for 64.1% of all failures
   - DIAGNOSIS: Optimized prompts had evidence but extracted wrong answers
   - May need better instruction tuning or few-shot examples

RECOMMENDATION:
  ‚Üí Overall accuracy: 31.2% on dev set
  ‚Üí Focus on improving EXTRACTION:
    1. Analyze extraction failures to identify patterns
    2. Add more few-shot examples for extraction signature
    3. Try different instruction prompts for AnswerExtraction
    4. Consider re-running MIPROv2 with explicit valset parameter
