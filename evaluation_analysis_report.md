# üìä MMESGBench Evaluation Results Analysis

## üéØ Executive Summary
- **Overall Accuracy**: 35.2% (302/857 questions)
- **Target vs Actual**: 41.5% target vs 35.2% actual
- **Performance Gap**: 6.3 percentage points below target

## üîÑ Document Substitution Impact Analysis

### Substituted Documents Performance
- **Gender 2024.pdf**: 25.0% (4/16) - HIGH risk
  - Reason: Different focus - Education vs Gender
- **ISO 14001.pdf**: 28.6% (4/14) - LOW risk
  - Reason: Official ISO standard vs third-party sources
- **Microsoft CDP Climate Change Response 2023.pdf**: 16.1% (5/31) - LOW risk
  - Reason: Newer version (2024 vs 2023)

### Impact Summary
- **Substituted Documents**: 21.3% accuracy
- **Normal Documents**: 36.3% accuracy
- **Accuracy Gap**: 15.0% (41.3% relative impact)

**‚ùó Key Finding**: Substituted documents show significantly lower performance.

## üìä Question Difficulty Analysis
- **Medium**: 34.2% accuracy (347 questions)
- **Hard**: 35.6% accuracy (133 questions)
- **Easy**: 36.0% accuracy (377 questions)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Evaluation Function Comparison

### Key Differences from MMESGBench:
1. **Numeric Evaluation**: MMESGBench uses more sophisticated precision handling and percentage conversion
2. **String Evaluation**: MMESGBench has more aggressive text cleaning and fuzzy matching with 80% threshold
3. **List Evaluation**: MMESGBench has more robust list parsing but similar F1 logic

### Potential Impact:
- **Numeric**: LOW - Both use 1% tolerance
- **String**: MEDIUM - Their text cleaning might catch edge cases we miss
- **List**: LOW - Similar F1 approach

## üìã Performance by Answer Format
- **Str**: 35.1% (299 questions)
- **Float**: 34.6% (148 questions)
- **Int**: 36.1% (207 questions)
- **List**: 34.6% (131 questions)
- **None**: 35.7% (148 questions)

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Performance Gaps:
1. **Document Substitution**: 41.3% impact from 3 substituted documents
2. **Question Complexity**: Complexity pattern needs investigation
3. **Evaluation Differences**: String cleaning differences may account for additional gaps

### Recommendations:
1. **High Priority**: Re-evaluate questions from substituted documents manually
2. **Medium Priority**: Implement MMESGBench's more sophisticated text cleaning
3. **Research**: Investigate format-specific performance patterns
4. **Validation**: Cross-check evaluation logic on known test cases

## üìà Next Steps for Phase 1
- **DSPy Integration**: Current 35.2% provides solid baseline for optimization
- **Focus Areas**: Target substituted document questions
- **Expected Improvement**: -5 percentage points possible
