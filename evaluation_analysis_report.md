### Impact Summary
- **Substituted Documents**: 21.3% accuracy
- **Normal Documents**: 36.3% accuracy
- **Accuracy Gap**: 15.0% (41.3% relative impact)

**‚ùó Key Finding**: Substituted documents show significantly lower performance.

## üìä Question Difficulty Analysis
- **Medium**: 34.2% accuracy (347 questions)
- **Hard**: 35.6% accuracy (133 questions)
- **Easy**: 36.0% accuracy (377 questions)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Evaluation Function Comparison & Results

### Key Differences Fixed:
1. **String Evaluation**: Implemented fuzzy matching (ANLS) with 0.5 threshold and substring matching
2. **List Evaluation**: Added fuzzy matching with 80% threshold for partial matches
3. **Numeric Evaluation**: Enhanced float tolerance and percentage handling
4. **Format Normalization**: Better handling of units, brackets, and punctuation

### Impact Measured (Before ‚Üí After MMESGBench Evaluation):
- **Overall**: 33.7% ‚Üí 39.9% (+6.2% improvement)
- **Questions Changed**: 92 total (75 newly correct, 17 newly incorrect)
- **String Format**: Significant gains from fuzzy matching (6 more lenient cases)
- **List Format**: Major improvements from partial matching (2 more lenient cases)

### Detailed Discrepancy Analysis:
- **Sample Analysis**: 50 questions tested
- **Our Original Evaluation**: 22.0% (11/50)
- **MMESGBench Logic**: 36.0% (18/50)
- **Difference**: +14.0% more lenient (9 questions)
- **Projected Full Dataset Gain**: ~131 additional correct answers
- **Actual Implementation Gain**: +58 correct answers (6.2% improvement)

## üìã Performance by Answer Format (MMESGBench Evaluation)
- **Int**: 42.5% (88/207 questions) - Improved
- **Str**: 38.5% (115/299 questions) - Major improvement from fuzzy matching
- **Float**: 33.8% (50/148 questions) - Slight decrease due to stricter tolerance
- **List**: 36.6% (48/131 questions) - Significant improvement from partial matching
- **None**: 48.0% (71/148 questions) - Strong performance

## üîç Root Cause Analysis (Updated)

### Performance Gaps Addressed:
1. ‚úÖ **Evaluation Logic Fixed**: 6.2% improvement by aligning with MMESGBench evaluation
2. üîÑ **Document Substitution**: Still impacts performance (needs manual re-labeling)
3. üîÑ **Question Complexity**: Pattern analysis pending

### Current Status:
- **39.9% accuracy achieved** (vs 41.5% target)
- **Only 1.6% gap remaining** (down from 6.3%)
- **Strong baseline established** for DSPy optimization

### Next Steps:
1. **High Priority**: Manual re-labeling of critical documents (Sum Yee assigned)
2. **DSPy Integration**: Ready for Phase 1 optimization with solid 39.9% baseline
3. **Expected Improvement**: 2-5% additional improvement possible

## üìà Phase 1 Readiness
- **Baseline Established**: 39.9% accuracy + 41.1% F1 with optimized ColBERT + MMESGBench evaluation
- **Memory Optimization**: Pre-computed retrievals + parallel generation working
- **Evaluation Alignment**: ‚úÖ Full compatibility with MMESGBench scoring confirmed
- **Infrastructure Ready**: PostgreSQL vector store, API integration, comprehensive evaluation pipeline
- **Code Organization**: Clean production codebase with archived historical scripts
