Question: According to the survey that is the percentage of Chinese who are paying more or about the same attention to politics after Trump's election?
Analysis: The survey provided does not specify the percentage of Chinese individuals specifically who are paying more or about the same attention to politics after Trump's election. The report focuses primarily on American demographics and does not include specific details about the Chinese population in relation to this question. If you need information about a different demographic or a summary of the findings from the American demographic, I can certainly help with that!
Extracted answer: Not answerable
Answer format: String
