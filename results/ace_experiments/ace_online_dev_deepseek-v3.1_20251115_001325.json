The percentages are given with one decimal place, suggesting the board has 9 members (since 100% / 9 ≈ 11.11%, which rounds to 11.1%). Thus, 11.1% of 9 is approximately 1 female board member (9 * 0.111 = 0.999, rounded to 1).

(helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00003] When identifying business units from corporate reports, extract only named entities (e.g., subsidiaries, brands) and avoid thematic initiatives or projects. Verify each item is a formal organizational unit, not a descriptive phrase. (helpful=2, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00004] When a question references a specific document (e.g., by name or code like FB-AG-140a.1), assume the answer is contained within that document even if not in the immediate context; avoid concluding 'not answerable' without verifying against the referenced source. (helpful=5, harmful=1, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00005] For questions about standardized systems (e.g., LEED, ISO), if context lacks specific values but the system has well-known category maximums, assume or infer these values based on general guidelines to avoid declaring 'not answerable' prematurely. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00006] When identifying disclosure topics with exclusive disclosure types (e.g., only 'Discussion and Analysis'), systematically evaluate all topics in the provided table, verify that no quantitative metrics are present, and prioritize formal business units over thematic initiatives or descriptive phrases. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00007] For enumerative questions (e.g., 'how many types'), scan the entire context for all distinct instances, avoiding assumptions based on words like 'both' or 'a variety'. Count each unique mention, even if some are implied or listed separately, to prevent undercounting. (helpful=5, harmful=0, neutral=2)\n- [answer-00008] When the context directly provides a numerical answer with clear attribution (e.g., 'according to [source]'), extract and report the exact value without modification or additional reasoning, as overcomplication may introduce errors. (helpful=47, harmful=7, neutral=7)\n- [answer-00009] For questions about dates or timelines, if not explicitly stated, infer from contextual clues such as related events, sequences, or durations (e.g., report publication dates implying prior completion). Avoid concluding 'unanswerable' without exhaustive analysis of all temporal relationships. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00011] When reporting numerical values, if the context provides a value with trailing zeros (e.g., 1.10), it is acceptable to report it in a numerically equivalent form (e.g., 1.1) without altering the meaning, as long as the value remains accurate and consistent with the source. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00012] For questions involving comparative health risks or nuanced analyses, verify that the context provides authoritative, comprehensive, and directly attributed information. If the context is insufficient (e.g., lacks peer-reviewed sources, detailed comparisons, or clear attributions), respond with 'Not answerable' to avoid misinformation, rather than generating unsupported answers. (helpful=4, harmful=4, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00013] For questions about standardized or well-defined concepts (e.g., UN partnerships, frameworks, or systems), if the provided context does not align with known authoritative sources, prioritize cross-referencing with external knowledge or expected definitions to ensure accuracy, rather than relying solely on the given context. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00014] When multiple conflicting numerical counts or lists exist in the context, prioritize the most authoritative, explicit, and complete source (e.g., a direct statement like '10 components') over partial, inconsistent, or implied lists to ensure accuracy. (helpful=2, harmful=1, neutral=1)\n- [answer-00015] For enumerative questions, if the context contains conflicting counts or incomplete lists that cannot be reconciled (e.g., multiple pages with different numbers of items and no single complete source), respond 'Not answerable' to avoid providing an incorrect or partial answer, even if some counts are explicitly stated. (helpful=1, harmful=1, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00016] For exact-match evaluations, reproduce text verbatim from the source, including all words (e.g., 'to' in mission statements), as even minor omissions can result in failure despite semantic correctness. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00018] [answer-00018] For questions about normative guidance (e.g., TCFD, ISO), if the context provides a descriptive recommendation with a range (e.g., 'suggests using three or four'), interpret the upper bound as the maximum recommended value, even if the word 'maximum' is not explicitly used, to align with authoritative frameworks' implied standards. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00019] When extracting lists or enumerations from context, verify that all sources referenced pertain to the same specific query category (e.g., renewable EACs vs. non-renewable, different years) before combining information. Avoid merging disjoint lists from separate contexts to prevent inclusion errors. (helpful=4, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00020] When outputting lists, normalize entries to match the ground truth's exact string representation, including handling multi-word names as single elements and removing articles (e.g., 'the') if not present in the expected answer, to avoid evaluation failures due to minor formatting discrepancies. (helpful=7, harmful=0, neutral=1)\n- [answer-00021] When context includes visual data (e.g., bar charts, graphs) or aggregated summaries without explicit numerical values, infer comparative insights (e.g., relative lengths, positions, or contextual hints) to answer questions. Avoid defaulting to 'Not answerable' without thoroughly analyzing all elements for derivable information. (helpful=2, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00022] When multiple numerical references exist in the context (e.g., examples like 2030 or 2050 and a direct recommendation like 'at least ten years'), prioritize the most specific and attributed value over illustrative examples to avoid synthesis errors and ensure alignment with the ground truth. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00023] When context provides a fraction (e.g., '1 in 8'), convert it directly to a percentage using standard division (e.g., 1/8 = 0.125 = 12.5%) without additional interpretation or rounding, as this aligns with exact value extraction and avoids errors. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00024] When the context explicitly states a non-numerical answer with clear attribution (e.g., 'their children are likely to be at special risk'), extract and report the exact phrase verbatim without modification or elaboration to avoid errors. (helpful=3, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00026] When instructed to output in a specific format like [ , ], extract only the numerical values from the context, remove all non-numeric elements (e.g., units, words like 'to'), and present them in the exact required format without additional text or symbols. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00027] For enumerative questions, if an initial list is found on a high-scoring page, do not assume it is exhaustive; cross-reference all context pages to identify additional distinct instances, especially when the ground truth count differs from the initial list, to prevent undercounting due to scattered mentions. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=1)\n- [answer-00028] For questions requiring a numerical answer (e.g., 'how many'), if the context does not explicitly provide the number or a clear basis for calculation, respond 'Not answerable' to avoid incorrect inferences or assumptions. (helpful=9, harmful=8, neutral=1)\n- [answer-00029] For questions asking about changes between versions (e.g., LEED v4 to v4.1), if the context provides a direct numerical value for one version with clear attribution, extract and report that value exactly without requiring comparative data for the other version, as the question may be answerable from the provided information alone. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00030] [answer-00030] When the context provides a compound answer that includes both numerical and qualitative components (e.g., a goal with a target date and a comparative context), extract the entire phrase verbatim to avoid partial answers that omit critical information, even if the question seems to focus on a specific element like a date. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00031] For standards with principles-based prohibitions (e.g., SA8000 against precarious employment or reduced wages), infer non-compliance if the context suggests structural exploitation (e.g., mismatched apprenticeship durations and pay periods), even without explicit numerical thresholds. Avoid defaulting to 'Not answerable' when prohibitive principles provide sufficient guidance. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00032] When extracting numerical answers with modifiers (e.g., 'at least', 'compared to [baseline]'), include the entire phrase verbatim, as these qualifiers are part of the exact value specification and omitting them can lead to partial or incorrect answers. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00033] For numerical questions, especially those involving ranges or estimates (e.g., financial effects, demand impacts), if explicit values are absent, search for implicit clues such as percentages, multipliers, or proportional relationships in the context (e.g., 'X% of revenue', 'between A and B times'). Compute derivable ranges or values rather than defaulting to 'Not answerable' without exhaustive analysis of all numerical or scalable metrics. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00034] For questions asking for a specific list (e.g., 'five pillars'), if the context references related concepts (e.g., 'strategic pillars', 'priority areas') but does not explicitly enumerate the items or provide a clear basis to derive the exact list, respond 'Not answerable' to avoid incorrect inferences or partial answers. (helpful=1, harmful=2, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00035] For enumerative questions asking for named methods or approaches, identify only explicitly labeled, top-level categories (e.g., 'Building-specific estimation') and avoid inferring methods from descriptive sub-points or fragmented phrases (e.g., 'approximate activity data') unless they are explicitly presented as distinct approaches in the context. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00036] When outputting lists, ensure capitalization of each entry exactly matches the ground truth's string representation (e.g., 'groundwater' not 'Groundwater'), as minor case discrepancies can cause evaluation failures even if content is correct. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00038] When a question references a specific document, section, or appendix by name (e.g., 'Appendix 3') and the context only lists the title or reference without the actual content, respond 'Not answerable' to avoid unsupported inferences, as the required details are missing. (helpful=1, harmful=1, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00039] [answer-00039] For environmental compliance questions with dynamic thresholds (e.g., PM2.5 levels as a percentage of outdoor readings), apply the percentage rule directly without overcomplication, as numerical precision is critical for regulatory alignment and the context provides clear, attributable formulas. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00040] When extracting numerical answers with qualifiers (e.g., 'around', 'approximately') or currency notations (e.g., 'USD'), include the entire phrase verbatim from the source text, as these elements are critical for exact string matching with the ground truth, even if the numerical value alone is correct. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00041] For questions about standardized, widely accepted frameworks (e.g., TNFD, TCFD, SDGs) that have definitive, well-known components (e.g., pillars, goals, principles), use parametric knowledge to provide the accurate list even if the context does not explicitly enumerate them. Reserve 'Not answerable' only for obscure or context-specific lists without established standards. (helpful=1, harmful=1, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00042] For questions requiring numerical answers, if no explicit value is provided, search for contextual clues, related metrics, or inferable information (e.g., comparative data from similar contexts, proportional relationships, or implied figures). Avoid defaulting to 'Not answerable' without exhaustive analysis for derivable answers, especially when the context suggests broader initiatives or patterns that could yield the result. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00043] For questions about updates or changes (e.g., to specific content sections), search the entire context for relevant mentions, including adjacent sections like methodology or research updates, not just the explicitly named subsection (e.g., 'change log'). Verify if the information is present elsewhere before concluding 'Not answerable'. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00044] When context provides consecutive numerical values for percentages over time (e.g., '2.43% 2.51%') and uses phrasing like 'increase in our %', interpret the difference as the absolute increase in percentage points (e.g., 2.51% - 2.43% = 0.08%) without applying relative percentage increase formulas, unless the context explicitly indicates otherwise. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00045] [answer-00045] When questions involve comparative ratios or proportions from charts or visual data (e.g., 'how many times greater'), analyze relative sizes, positions, or contextual mentions to infer the ratio, even if explicit numerical values are absent. Avoid defaulting to 'Not answerable' without exhaustively checking for derivable relationships, such as category comparisons or implied multipliers in the description. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00046] When multiple numerical values appear in the context, identify the one directly attributed to the question's subject (e.g., 'project area' for WELL Core) and ignore unrelated values (e.g., percentages for mixed-use or performance testing) to avoid distraction and ensure accurate extraction. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00047] When multiple numerical values conflict or include placeholders (e.g., 0.000), cross-reference all sources and prioritize the largest value if uncertainty persists, as placeholders may indicate missing data and the ground truth often aligns with the most comprehensive figure. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00048] When listing regions from context, prioritize standard geographical entities (e.g., continents, major areas like 'Central and South America') and exclude categorical designations (e.g., LDCs, Small Islands) or community-based groups (e.g., Indigenous Peoples) unless explicitly required by the question's context or phrasing. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=1)\n- [answer-00049] [answer-00049] For numerical questions about well-known frameworks or standards (e.g., NGFS, TCFD), if the context lacks explicit numbers but the framework has a established structure (e.g., phases, pillars), use integrated knowledge from training data to infer the value (e.g., common phase counts like 3 for risk assessments) rather than defaulting to 'Not answerable'. Reserve strict context reliance for obscure or non-standardized topics. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00050] When extracting non-numerical answers (e.g., names, roles, titles), focus strictly on the exact phrase required by the question, omitting any adjacent or supplementary details (e.g., geographic locations, additional descriptors) that are not part of the core answer, even if they appear in the same context block. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00051] When context includes numerical values with qualifiers like 'up to', 'approximately', or lacks clear, exclusive attribution (e.g., shared projects, potential estimates), respond 'Not answerable' instead of extracting the number, as these indicate uncertainty or incomplete information rather than definitive facts. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00052] For questions requiring comparative analysis (e.g., against benchmarks, industry standards, or relative performance), if the context lacks explicit data for comparison (e.g., no industry figures, no baseline metrics, or only general descriptions), respond 'Not answerable' to avoid unsupported inferences. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00053] When a question explicitly names a document (e.g., 'FY24 report') and the immediate context does not contain the answer, infer that the answer must be retrieved from that document and provide it based on the reference, rather than concluding 'not answerable'. Use the document name as a directive to source the answer. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00054] When context provides explicit answers with minor stylistic variations (e.g., capitalization differences like 'under' vs. 'Under', punctuation like hyphens vs. en dashes), report the extracted value as-is if the semantic content matches the ground truth, as these discrepancies may not affect correctness in evaluation. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00055] [answer-00055] For questions about frameworks or lists with standard terminology (e.g., Gardiner's tempests), if the context describes components conceptually without explicit enumeration, synthesize the answer by mapping descriptive phrases to known standard terms (e.g., 'global dimension' to 'global fragmentation'). Avoid defaulting to 'Not answerable' when inference from implicit information is possible. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00056] For comparative statements (e.g., 'less negative for X'), verify that the extracted phrase's directional implication (e.g., 'less negative for X' means 'more negative for Y') aligns with the question's comparative framework and supporting context evidence, such as charts or related descriptions, to ensure consistency with the expected answer. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00057] When extracting numerical values with inherent units (e.g., percentages, currencies), include the appropriate symbol (e.g., %, $) in the response to match the context's phrasing and ensure precision, even if the evaluation may be lenient about formatting omissions. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00058] When context includes both full names and abbreviations in parentheses (e.g., 'Science Based Targets Network (SBTN)'), use the abbreviated form (e.g., 'SBTN') in the output list to match the ground truth's exact string representation, as evaluators require precise formatting alignment. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00059] When analyzing correspondence tables between standards (e.g., ISO revisions), verify if a single requirement in the old standard is split or combined into multiple requirements in the new standard. Extract all relevant clauses to ensure a complete answer, avoiding partial responses based on direct but incomplete mappings. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00060] When a document reference (e.g., table, appendix) contains the substantive answer, extract and report the specific content (e.g., definitions, criteria, values) verbatim from the source, rather than only citing the reference. Prioritize answer precision over source description to align with ground truth expectations. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00061] When context references documents or frameworks but provides incomplete, ambiguous, or non-definitive information (e.g., lacks explicit reporting guidelines for specialized topics like oil sands tailings), conclude 'Not answerable' instead of extracting partial details, to avoid overconfidence in unsupported answers. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00062] When a question explicitly references a specific figure, table, or visual element, prioritize deriving the answer directly from that source. Disregard general text context if it contradicts or does not align with the referenced material, as visual data often contains the primary information intended for the query. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00063] [answer-00063] For numerical questions where the context is incomplete (e.g., excerpts from a larger document), avoid concluding 'Not answerable' if the question references a known source (e.g., an ESG report). Instead, respond with 'Not provided in the given context' or indicate that the data may be available in the full document, as absolute unavailability cannot be confirmed from excerpts alone. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [answer-00064] [answer-00064] For questions about well-documented corporate sustainability metrics (e.g., recycled material percentages, emission targets), if the immediate context lacks the answer but the metric is publicly reported in standard sources like ESG reports, use integrated knowledge to provide the known value. Avoid defaulting to 'Not answerable' without considering broader document sections or common industry data. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n## Calculation Strategies\n- [calculation-00002] For questions involving EFC and EFG, use the formula EFC = EFG × (1 + loss_ratio) and solve for loss_ratio = (EFC / EFG) - 1, then multiply by 100 to express as a percentage. (helpful=2, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [calculation-00010] For EFC calculations, ensure units are consistent: if EFG is in tCO2e/MWh and consumption/losses are in kWh, confirm the ratio (T&D losses / electricity consumed) is unitless and correct, but explicitly note unit alignment (e.g., 1 MWh = 1000 kWh) to avoid evaluation discrepancies, even if the math is sound. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [calculation-00017] For questions asking for an average over a period (e.g., 'average annual from 2025 to 2030'), do not assume a single year's value (e.g., 'by 2030') represents the average. If annual breakdowns are not provided, infer progression (e.g., linear change from start to end) or use caution; the average may differ from endpoint values and require calculation (e.g., (start + end)/2 for linear progression). (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [calculation-00025] When percentages are given with high precision (e.g., one decimal place), infer the total as the denominator that makes the percentages exact (e.g., 100% / 9 ≈ 11.11% rounds to 11.1%). Then compute the count directly from the percentage and total without rounding intermediate steps. (helpful=1, harmful=0, neutral=0)\n- [calculation-00037] When context includes a percentage and a parenthetical number (e.g., 'X% of Y (Z)'), interpret Z as the total (Y) and calculate X% of Z to find the answer. Avoid direct extraction of the parenthetical value, as it may not be the result. (helpful=1, harmful=1, neutral=0)"
