However, the question asks for the automotive sector specifically, and the context does not provide sector-specific data; it only gives general or anonymized examples. Additionally, the context mentions that emissions-intensive activities (e.g., upstream and downstream from categories 4 and 9) may need to be considered beyond the 5% threshold, but it does not quantify how many additional categories this might require for the automotive sector. Since the context lacks automotive-specific percentages and details on additional categories, the question cannot be answered precisely from the provided context.",
