      "question": "How is electricity sold by one public organization to another accounted for in Scope 1 and 2 reporting?",
      "doc_id": "GHG Public.pdf",
      "gold_answer": "Seller reports Scope 1, buyer reports Scope 2",
      "gold_sources": [],
      "baseline_answer": "Based on the context provided, we can analyze the Scope 1 and 2 reporting for the electricity sold from one public organization to another:\n\n1. **Scope 1 Reporting**: Company A reports its direct emissions from power generation under Scope 1. However, the context does not specify whether Organization C or D falls under this category. If Organization C is responsible for the generation and transmission of electricity, then the emissions associated with T&D losses would not be reported under Scope 2, as they would already be accounted for under Scope 1. On the other hand, if Organization D owns or controls the T&D system, then the emissions associated with T&D losses would be reported under Scope 2.\n\n2. **Scope 2 Reporting**: Scope 2 only accounts for the portion of the direct emissions from generating electricity that is actually consumed by the organization. In this scenario, since Organization D is an end user consuming the purchased electricity, the emissions associated with the 95 MWh of electricity it buys from Organization C would be reported under Scope 2. This is because the emissions are considered indirect and occur at the point of generation, which is outside the organizational boundary of Organization D.\n\n3. **Scope 3 Reporting**: Upstream T&D losses are accounted for in Scope 3. Since Organization C consumes 5 MWh and sells the rest to Organization D, the emissions related to these upstream T&D losses would be included in Scope 3 reporting for Organization C, and possibly in Scope 3 for Organization D depending on the nature of their operations.\n\n4. **Optional Information**: Company B reports emissions from the purchased electricity sold to a non-end user as optional information. This suggests that while not mandatory, organizations can choose to report such emissions, but they are typically not included in Scope 2.\n\nIn summary, the electricity sold from Organization C to Organization D would be reported under Scope 2 for Organization D, and potentially under Scope 3 for Organization C, depending on the ownership and control of the T&D system. The emissions from the upstream T&D losses would be reported under Scope 3 for Organization C.",

      "gepa_answer": "- **Direct Emissions Reporting (Scope 1):** Company A reports its direct emissions from power generation under Scope 1. This means that any emissions from its own power generation activities are included in its direct emissions.\n- **Indirect Emissions Reporting (Scope 2):** Scope 2 emissions are associated with the purchased electricity that is consumed by the reporting organization. Here, Organization D consumes the 95 MWh of electricity that it purchased from Organization C. According to the context, if an organization owns or controls the T&D system but generates electricity rather than purchasing it, the emissions associated with T&D losses are not reported under Scope 2 because they are already accounted for under Scope 1. However, since the context specifies that Organization C consumes 5 MWh and sells the remaining 95 MWh to Organization D, and Organization D is consuming this electricity, the emissions from the 95 MWh are reported under Scope 2.\n\nTherefore, the electricity sold by Organization C to Organization D is accounted for as follows:\n- Organization C's emissions from the 5 MWh it consumes are reported under Scope 1.\n- Organization D's emissions from the 95 MWh it consumes are reported under Scope 2.",

We are given that the electricity consumed is 10,000 kWh and T&D losses are 1,000 kWh.

      "doc_id": "LEED 2025.pdf",
      "gold_answer": "75% by weight of product",
      "gold_sources": [],
      "baseline_answer": "The reasoning provided indicates that the weighting of GS Benchmark assessments has changed from LEED v4 to v4.1. In LEED v4, the compliance levels were strictly based on cost, with the full assessment being valued at 150% of the cost. However, in LEED v4.1, the focus shifted towards ingredient assessment, and the weighting became more flexible. Under the new requirements, a GS Benchmark assessment can be valued at 75% of the product's weight or 95% of the product's weight, depending on the level of coverage. This suggests an increased emphasis on comprehensive ingredient assessment rather than just screening, which may reflect a more detailed and thorough approach to evaluating the environmental impacts of products.\n\nThe context also provides additional information about other changes in LEED v4.1, such as the incorporation of greenhouse gas emissions as a metric for building energy performance and modifications to the EPD credit to simplify the selection of products with life cycle assessment data. However, these details do not directly pertain to the change in the weighting of GS Benchmark assessments.",
      "baseline_score": 0.5,
      "gepa_answer": "From the context, it is evident that the previous LEED v4 Option 2 had two levels of compliance: GS List Translator at 100% of cost and GS full assessment at 150% of cost. However, the newer requirements for LEED v4.1 have changed the weighting system for Option 2. According to the context, GS Benchmark assessments are now valued at 75% by weight of product (equivalent to 0.75 products) or for 95% by weight of product (equivalent to 0.95 products). This indicates a shift towards rewarding more specific and comprehensive ingredient assessments, rather than just listing translators or full assessments based on cost.",
