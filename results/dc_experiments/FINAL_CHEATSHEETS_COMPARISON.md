## Updated Cheatsheet

- **ESG Terminology**:
  - **GHG (Greenhouse Gas)**: Refers to gases that contribute to global warming, including carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane, and nitrous oxide.
  - **Scope 1, 2, 3 Hierarchy for Emissions Reporting**:
    - **Scope 1**: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources.
    - **Scope 2**: Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the reporting entity.
    - **Scope 3**: All other indirect emissions (upstream and downstream) not included in Scope 2 that occur in the value chain of the reporting entity.
  - **Direct Material Suppliers**: Companies that provide raw materials or components directly to the organization for use in its products or services.

- **Calculation Patterns**:
  - **Total Emissions Calculation**: Sum up emissions from all selected scopes. For example, if Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are given, add them together to get the total emissions covered by the target.
  - **Percentage Calculation**: Use the formula \((\text{Part} / \text{Whole}) \times 100\). For example, if 73.5% of Dell's direct material suppliers reported sustainability initiatives in FY24, the calculation would be \((73.5 / 100) \times 100 = 73.5\%\).

- **Format-Specific Tips**:
  - **List Answers**: Use exact names from the context. For example, "RE100", "Science Based Targets Network (SBTN)", "UN Global Compact", "We Are Still In", "World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)", "Responsible Business Alliance".
  - **Float Answers**: Match the precision level from the source data. For example, if the context provides a figure like "73.5%" or "343.25 survey responses," use the same precision in your answer.

- **Document Navigation**:
  - **Emissions Data**: Typically found in tables with column headers such as "Electricity Consumption (MWh)" and "Electricity Sales (MWh)".
  - **Date Ranges**: Often in report headers or footers.
  - **Specific Information**: Look for it on specific pages; for example, information about signatory frameworks is often found on pages related to commitments and memberships.
  - **Tailings Facilities**: Found on pages describing operational risks or environmental impact assessments, typically starting from page numbers like 155.

- **Common Pitfalls**:
  - **Don't Confuse 'MWh' vs 'GWh'**: Ensure you correctly interpret and convert between megawatt-hours (MWh) and gigawatt-hours (GWh). Note that \(1 \text{ GWh} = 1000 \text{ MWh}\).
  - **Check if Percentages are Already Calculated or Need Computation**: Ensure you are using the correct values and formulas to avoid double-counting or incorrect calculations.
  - **Avoid Misinterpreting Financial Figures**: Ensure you correctly interpret and convert between 'million' and 'billion' in financial figures. For example, "83 million INR ($1 million)" indicates the conversion from INR to USD.
  - **Real Wage Increase Consideration**: Account for inflation when calculating real wage increases.
  - **Scope 3 Category 11 Minimum Boundary**: Be aware of the guidance provided by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for identifying the minimum boundary for Scope 3 Category 11 emissions (use of sold products).

- **Additional Insights**:
  - **Plastic Recycling in Consumer Hardware**: To find the percentage of recycled plastic in Google's consumer hardware product portfolio, look for specific pages or sections dedicated to sustainability or material usage. The information might be listed under "Sustainability Initiatives" or "Product Lifecycle Management."

These updates will help in addressing future ESG questions more effectively.

### Calculation Patterns:
- **Distance-Based Emissions Calculation**: Calculate emissions from travel by multiplying the total distance traveled by the emission factor.
  - Example: "Total air travel Scope 3 emissions = Total miles traveled by air × Emission factor (kg CO2e/mile)."
- **Unit Conversion**: Convert emissions from kg CO2e to tCO2e by dividing by 1000.
  - Example: "Convert kg CO2e to tCO2e by dividing by 1000."

### ESG Terminology:
- **GHG = Greenhouse Gas**
- **Scope 1, 2, 3 Hierarchy for Emissions Reporting**:
  - **Scope 1**: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources.
  - **Scope 2**: Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the reporting company.
  - **Scope 3**: All other indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain.
  - Example: "Scope 3 emissions include those from employee air travel."

### Format-Specific Tips:
- **List Answers**: Use exact company/division names from context.
  - Example: "Use 'Apple' as mentioned in the context."
- **Float Answers**: Match the precision level from the source data.
  - Example: "For float answers, match the precision level from the source data, e.g., 45.0 tCO2e."

### Document Navigation:
- **Emissions Data**: Typically found in tables with column headers indicating units like EJ or USD.
  - Example: "Emissions data usually in tables with column headers."
- **Date Ranges**: Date ranges often appear in report headers or footers.
  - Example: "Date ranges often in report headers or footers."
- **Specific Information**: Look for detailed breakdowns or specific scenarios in designated pages or sections.
  - Example: "Information on specific scenarios (e.g., Net-Zero Ambition Scenario) is typically detailed on pages like 111-114."

### Common Pitfalls:
- **Don't Confuse Financial Figures**: Be cautious with large numbers and ensure correct unit conversion (e.g., million vs. billion).
  - Example: "Don't confuse 'million' vs 'billion' in financial figures."
- **Check If Percentages Are Already Calculated**: Avoid redundant calculations if percentages are already provided.
  - Example: "Ensure percentages are not unnecessarily recalculated if already given."

### Additional Insights:
- **Identify Sensitivity Trends**: Look for information on how different technologies are affected by changes in discount rates or other economic factors.
  - Example: "Identify technologies with lower sensitivity to WACC increases."
- **Focus on Specific Categories**: Pay attention to detailed breakdowns provided in the document to identify the largest share of emissions within specific categories.
  - Example: "To identify the largest share of emissions within a specific category, focus on detailed breakdowns provided in the document."
- **Review Relevant Sections**: When integrating multiple ESG disclosures, ensure all relevant sections are reviewed.
  - Example: "Review all relevant sections for integrated ESG disclosures."
- **Participant Identification**: Look for specific affiliations or names listed in the document to identify participants from particular organizations.
  - Example: "Participants from specific organizations can be identified by their affiliation in the document."

### New Insights:
- **Risk Identification**: Look for specific pages or sections where risks and challenges are discussed.
  - Example: "Risks and challenges are typically detailed in feedback or discussion sections."
- **Country/Area Listing**: Countries/areas listed in specific sections (like C0.3) are often found in the context of operational locations.
  - Example: "Countries/areas in which a company operates are typically listed in response to specific disclosure codes like C0.3."

These updates further enhance the cheatsheet's utility for future ESG questions by providing more comprehensive guidance on handling various types of information and avoiding common pitfalls.

## Key Observations

### 1. Cheatsheet Evolution

**Dev Set (35 lines)**:
- Most comprehensive initial cheatsheet
- Rich in specific examples and detailed guidance
- Includes domain-specific terms like "Direct Material Suppliers"
- More verbose explanations

**Test Cold Start (53 lines)**:
- Longest final cheatsheet (learned from 654 questions)
- Better structured with clear section headers
- More practical examples inline
- Added "New Insights" section showing continuous learning
- More focused on actionable patterns

**Test Bootstrap (27 lines)**:
- Most concise cheatsheet
- Simplified from dev set (35 -> 27 lines)
- Retained core patterns but condensed explanations
- Less verbose, more direct guidance
- Potentially over-compressed, losing useful details

### 2. Content Similarities

All three cheatsheets converge on core concepts:
- ESG Terminology (GHG, Scope 1/2/3)
- Calculation Patterns (totals, percentages, unit conversions)
- Format-Specific Tips (List, Float precision)
- Document Navigation (tables, headers, footers)
- Common Pitfalls (million vs billion, unit confusion)

### 3. Key Differences

**Dev Set Unique Content**:
- Direct Material Suppliers definition
- MWh vs GWh conversion
- Real wage increase considerations
- Scope 3 Category 11 guidance
- Tailings Facilities navigation

**Cold Start Unique Content**:
- Distance-based emissions calculation
- Sensitivity trends analysis
- Risk identification guidance
- Country/area listing patterns
- More granular navigation examples

**Bootstrap Unique Content**:
- Miles to kilometers conversion
- Outcome promotion pattern

### 4. Performance vs Cheatsheet Size

Interesting inverse relationship:
- **Dev Set**: 35 lines -> 43.0% accuracy (best)
- **Cold Start**: 53 lines -> 35.6% accuracy
- **Bootstrap**: 27 lines -> 34.7% accuracy (worst)

**Observation**: Longer cheatsheets did NOT improve performance. In fact, the most concise dev set cheatsheet (35 lines) achieved the best accuracy (43.0%), while the longest cold start cheatsheet (53 lines) performed worse (35.6%).

### 5. Critical Weakness

**All three cheatsheets show 0% accuracy on null format questions**, indicating that DC's learning mechanism failed to develop any strategy for recognizing unanswerable questions, regardless of cheatsheet content or length.

---

## Conclusions

1. **Cold start learned more patterns** (53 lines) but this didn't translate to better performance
2. **Bootstrap compression** (35 -> 27 lines) may have lost critical information
3. **Cheatsheet quality matters more than quantity** - Dev set's balanced approach worked best
4. **Missing null detection** is the critical gap across all variants
5. **Domain knowledge accumulation** is visible but doesn't overcome fundamental architectural limitations

---

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on quality over quantity** when curating cheatsheets
2. **Explicit null handling** needs to be added to DC's curator logic
3. **Compression strategy** for bootstrap should preserve critical patterns
4. **Format-specific cheatsheets** might perform better than consolidated ones
5. **Dev set size** (93 questions) appears sufficient for initial cheatsheet learning
