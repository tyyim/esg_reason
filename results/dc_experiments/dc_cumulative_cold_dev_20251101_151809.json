  "final_cheatsheet": "## Updated Cheatsheet\n\n- **ESG Terminology**:\n  - **GHG**: Greenhouse Gas\n  - **EFC (Electricity Flow Charge)**: The ratio of total CO\u2082 emissions from generation to electricity consumed during transmission and distribution (T&D).\n  - **EFG (Electricity Flow Generation)**: The emissions factor generated from the consumption of electricity during T&D.\n  - **Scope 1, 2, 3 Hierarchy for Emissions Reporting**:\n    - **Scope 1**: Direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the company.\n    - **Scope 2**: Indirect emissions from the purchase of electricity, steam, heating, or cooling from a utility.\n    - **Scope 3**: All other indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain, including both upstream and downstream activities.\n  - **sDA300,50%**: A metric used in daylight simulation to indicate the percentage of regularly occupied floor area achieving a target daylight autonomy of 300 lux for at least 50% of the year.\n\n- **Calculation Patterns**:\n  - **Percentage Calculation**: \\((\\text{Part} / \\text{Whole}) \\times 100\\)\n  - **EFC Calculation**: \\(EFC = EFG \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{\\text{T&D Loss}}{\\text{Electricity Consumed}}\\right)\\)\n  - **Daylight Simulation Target**: For non-dwelling spaces, at least 55% of the regularly occupied floor area must achieve an average sDA300,50% of 50%.\n\n- **Format-Specific Tips**:\n  - **List Answers**: Use exact company/division names from context.\n  - **Float Answers**: Match the precision level from source data (e.g., use MWh for energy measurements).\n\n- **Document Navigation**:\n  - **Emissions Data**: Usually found in tables with column headers.\n  - **Date Ranges**: Often mentioned in report headers or footers.\n  - **Survey Completion Date**: Typically found on specific pages, such as Page 6 in the given context.\n\n- **Common Pitfalls**:\n  - **Don't Confuse Units**: Avoid mixing up units like 'MWh' (megawatt-hours) with other energy units.\n  - **Verify Calculations**: Ensure if percentages are already calculated or require manual computation.\n  - **Avoid Redundant Information**: Focus on unique insights rather than repeating existing ones.\n  - **Check Credit Ratings**: Ensure you understand the rating scale when dealing with investment grade bonds.\n\n### Additional Insights:\n- **Water Stress Regions Identification**: Tools such as the **Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas** are commonly used to assess water risk and stress levels in different regions globally.\n\nThese updates should help in addressing future ESG-related questions more effectively."
