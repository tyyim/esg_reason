  "final_cheatsheet": "## Updated Cheatsheet\n\n- **ESG Terminology**:\n  - **GHG (Greenhouse Gas)**: Refers to gases that contribute to global warming, including carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane, and nitrous oxide.\n  - **Scope 1, 2, 3 Hierarchy for Emissions Reporting**:\n    - **Scope 1**: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources.\n    - **Scope 2**: Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the reporting entity.\n    - **Scope 3**: All other indirect emissions (upstream and downstream) not included in Scope 2 that occur in the value chain of the reporting entity.\n  - **Direct Material Suppliers**: Companies that provide raw materials or components directly to the organization for use in its products or services.\n\n- **Calculation Patterns**:\n  - **Total Emissions Calculation**: Sum up emissions from all selected scopes. For example, if Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are given, add them together to get the total emissions covered by the target.\n  - **Percentage Calculation**: Use the formula \\((\\text{Part} / \\text{Whole}) \\times 100\\). For example, if 73.5% of Dell's direct material suppliers reported sustainability initiatives in FY24, the calculation would be \\((73.5 / 100) \\times 100 = 73.5\\%\\).\n\n- **Format-Specific Tips**:\n  - **List Answers**: Use exact names from the context. For example, \"RE100\", \"Science Based Targets Network (SBTN)\", \"UN Global Compact\", \"We Are Still In\", \"World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)\", \"Responsible Business Alliance\".\n  - **Float Answers**: Match the precision level from the source data. For example, if the context provides a figure like \"73.5%\" or \"343.25 survey responses,\" use the same precision in your answer.\n\n- **Document Navigation**:\n  - **Emissions Data**: Typically found in tables with column headers such as \"Electricity Consumption (MWh)\" and \"Electricity Sales (MWh)\".\n  - **Date Ranges**: Often in report headers or footers.\n  - **Specific Information**: Look for it on specific pages; for example, information about signatory frameworks is often found on pages related to commitments and memberships.\n  - **Tailings Facilities**: Found on pages describing operational risks or environmental impact assessments, typically starting from page numbers like 155.\n\n- **Common Pitfalls**:\n  - **Don't Confuse 'MWh' vs 'GWh'**: Ensure you correctly interpret and convert between megawatt-hours (MWh) and gigawatt-hours (GWh). Note that \\(1 \\text{ GWh} = 1000 \\text{ MWh}\\).\n  - **Check if Percentages are Already Calculated or Need Computation**: Ensure you are using the correct values and formulas to avoid double-counting or incorrect calculations.\n  - **Avoid Misinterpreting Financial Figures**: Ensure you correctly interpret and convert between 'million' and 'billion' in financial figures. For example, \"83 million INR ($1 million)\" indicates the conversion from INR to USD.\n  - **Real Wage Increase Consideration**: Account for inflation when calculating real wage increases.\n  - **Scope 3 Category 11 Minimum Boundary**: Be aware of the guidance provided by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for identifying the minimum boundary for Scope 3 Category 11 emissions (use of sold products).\n\n- **Additional Insights**:\n  - **Plastic Recycling in Consumer Hardware**: To find the percentage of recycled plastic in Google's consumer hardware product portfolio, look for specific pages or sections dedicated to sustainability or material usage. The information might be listed under \"Sustainability Initiatives\" or \"Product Lifecycle Management.\"\n\nThese updates will help in addressing future ESG questions more effectively."
