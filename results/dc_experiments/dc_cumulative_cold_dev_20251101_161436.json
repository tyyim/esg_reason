Highlight key points such as the scope of reporting and the ownership/control of T&D systems.\n   - **Float**: Present numerical answers as floating-point numbers for precision.\n   - **Int**: Use integer values for specific point counts or whole numbers.\n\n**Generalizable Insights**:\n- **Business Unit Contributions**: Identify which business units are involved in specific sustainable initiatives mentioned in the ESG report.\n- **GHG Reduction Initiatives**: Recognize common types of initiatives (e.g., cloud computing, retail operations, logistics, office management, renewable energy) that typically contribute to GHG reductions.\n- **Data Center Efficiency**: Focus on data center operations and energy efficiency as a significant contributor to Scope 2 emissions.\n- **Supply Chain Management**: Consider supply chain management and logistics as critical areas for Scope 3 emissions reduction.\n- **Renewable Energy Sources**: Note the importance of renewable energy sources (e.g., solar power) in reducing overall emissions.\n\n**Example Entry**:\n- **Question**: Which business units of Alibaba Group contributed to the GHG reduction according to the Alibaba Group Holding Limited?\n- **Answer**: Business units involved in cloud computing, retail operations, logistics, sustainable office management, and renewable energy initiatives likely contributed to GHG reductions.\n- **Str**: Str\n\n**Updated Cheatsheet**:\n\n1. **Terminology**:\n   - **ESG**: Environmental, Social, and Governance factors.\n   - **Scope 1**: Direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the organization.\n   - **Scope 2**: Indirect emissions from the purchase of electricity, steam, heating, or cooling from a utility.\n   - **Scope 3**: Indirect emissions from activities of the organization\u2019s value chain, both upstream and downstream.\n   - **EFC (Emission Factor at Consumption)**: The emission factor used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity consumption.\n   - **EFG (Emission Factor at Generation)**: The emission factor used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation.\n\n2. **Calculation Patterns**:\n   - **Formulas**:\n     - \\( \\text{EFC} = \\text{EFG} \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{\\text{T&D Losses}}{\\text{Electricity Consumed}}\\right) \\)\n     - Percentage of T&D losses: \\( \\frac{\\text{T&D"
