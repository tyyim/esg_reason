  "final_cheatsheet": "## Updated Cheatsheet\n\n- **ESG Terminology**:\n  - **GHG (Greenhouse Gas)**: Refers to gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.\n  - **Scope 1, 2, 3 Hierarchy for Emissions Reporting**: Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources; Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the reporting organization; Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions not included in Scope 2 that occur in the value chain of the reporting organization, including both upstream and downstream emissions.\n  - **Direct Material Suppliers**: Companies that provide raw materials directly to the organization for use in its products or services.\n\n- **Calculation Patterns**:\n  - **Total Emissions Calculation**: Sum up the emissions reported under different scopes. For example, if Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are given, the total would be \\( \\text{Total Emissions} = \\text{Scope 1 Emissions} + \\text{Scope 2 Emissions} \\).\n  - **Percentage Calculation**: Compute percentages using the formula \\( \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Part}}{\\text{Whole}} \\right) \\times 100 \\). Note: Ensure to check if the given percentages are already calculated or need further processing.\n\n- **Format-Specific Tips**:\n  - **List Answers**: Use exact company/division names from context. For example, \"Google is a signatory of RE100, Science Based Targets Network (SBTN), UN Global Compact, We Are Still In, and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).\"\n  - **Float Answers**: Match the precision level from the source data. For example, if the data is given to two decimal places, ensure your answer is also precise to two decimal places.\n\n- **Document Navigation**:\n  - **Emissions Data**: Typically found in tables with column headers specifying the scope of emissions.\n  - **Themes and Findings**: Overarching themes and key findings are often mentioned in the overview or introduction sections.\n  - **Signatory/Membership Information**: Usually listed in the \"About Us\" or \"Partnerships\" section of reports.\n  - **Date Ranges**: Often found in report headers or footers.\n  - **Tailings Facilities Information**: Found on pages dedicated to environmental impact assessments or specific operational sections, such as page 155 in the provided context.\n  - **Direct Material Supplier Reporting**: Look for sections detailing supplier engagement and sustainability initiatives, often starting from page 15 in the provided context.\n\n- **Common Pitfalls**:\n  - **Don't confuse 'million' vs 'billion' in financial figures**: Double-check the scale of numbers provided.\n  - **Check if percentages are already calculated or need computation**: Verify the context to determine if the given percentages are pre-calculated or need further processing.\n  - **Avoid misinterpreting numerical values**: Ensure accurate extraction and formatting of numbers, especially when dealing with large quantities like survey responses.\n\n- **Additional Insights**:\n  - **Identifying Regions Based on Climate Change Impacts**: Look for sections discussing climate change impacts, such as heat-humidity mortality risk and maize yield loss, to identify affected regions.\n  - **Principal Hazards and Risks**: Examine parts of the document that discuss principal hazards and associated risks expected at specific levels of global warming, such as 1.5\u00b0C or 4.2\u20135.4\u00b0C.\n\nThis update includes insights from the recent question-answer pair, focusing on identifying regions based on climate change impacts and ensuring accurate extraction and interpretation of numerical values."
