  "final_cheatsheet": "## Updated Cheatsheet\n\n### Calculation Patterns:\n- **Distance-Based Emissions Calculation**: Calculate emissions from travel by multiplying the total distance traveled by the emission factor.\n  - Example: \"Total air travel Scope 3 emissions = Total miles traveled by air \u00d7 Emission factor (kg CO2e/mile).\"\n- **Unit Conversion**: Convert emissions from kg CO2e to tCO2e by dividing by 1000.\n  - Example: \"Convert kg CO2e to tCO2e by dividing by 1000.\"\n\n### ESG Terminology:\n- **GHG = Greenhouse Gas**\n- **Scope 1, 2, 3 Hierarchy for Emissions Reporting**:\n  - **Scope 1**: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources.\n  - **Scope 2**: Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the reporting company.\n  - **Scope 3**: All other indirect emissions that occur in a company\u2019s value chain.\n  - Example: \"Scope 3 emissions include those from employee air travel.\"\n\n### Format-Specific Tips:\n- **List Answers**: Use exact company/division names from context.\n  - Example: \"Use 'Apple' as mentioned in the context.\"\n- **Float Answers**: Match the precision level from the source data.\n  - Example: \"For float answers, match the precision level from the source data, e.g., 45.0 tCO2e.\"\n\n### Document Navigation:\n- **Emissions Data**: Typically found in tables with column headers indicating units like EJ or USD.\n  - Example: \"Emissions data usually in tables with column headers.\"\n- **Date Ranges**: Date ranges often appear in report headers or footers.\n  - Example: \"Date ranges often in report headers or footers.\"\n- **Specific Information**: Look for detailed breakdowns or specific scenarios in designated pages or sections.\n  - Example: \"Information on specific scenarios (e.g., Net-Zero Ambition Scenario) is typically detailed on pages like 111-114.\"\n\n### Common Pitfalls:\n- **Don't Confuse Financial Figures**: Be cautious with large numbers and ensure correct unit conversion (e.g., million vs. billion).\n  - Example: \"Don't confuse 'million' vs 'billion' in financial figures.\"\n- **Check If Percentages Are Already Calculated**: Avoid redundant calculations if percentages are already provided.\n  - Example: \"Ensure percentages are not unnecessarily recalculated if already given.\"\n\n### Additional Insights:\n- **Identify Sensitivity Trends**: Look for information on how different technologies are affected by changes in discount rates or other economic factors.\n  - Example: \"Identify technologies with lower sensitivity to WACC increases.\"\n- **Focus on Specific Categories**: Pay attention to detailed breakdowns provided in the document to identify the largest share of emissions within specific categories.\n  - Example: \"To identify the largest share of emissions within a specific category, focus on detailed breakdowns provided in the document.\"\n- **Review Relevant Sections**: When integrating multiple ESG disclosures, ensure all relevant sections are reviewed.\n  - Example: \"Review all relevant sections for integrated ESG disclosures.\"\n- **Participant Identification**: Look for specific affiliations or names listed in the document to identify participants from particular organizations.\n  - Example: \"Participants from specific organizations can be identified by their affiliation in the document.\"\n\n### New Insights:\n- **Risk Identification**: Look for specific pages or sections where risks and challenges are discussed.\n  - Example: \"Risks and challenges are typically detailed in feedback or discussion sections.\"\n- **Country/Area Listing**: Countries/areas listed in specific sections (like C0.3) are often found in the context of operational locations.\n  - Example: \"Countries/areas in which a company operates are typically listed in response to specific disclosure codes like C0.3.\"\n\nThese updates further enhance the cheatsheet's utility for future ESG questions by providing more comprehensive guidance on handling various types of information and avoiding common pitfalls."
