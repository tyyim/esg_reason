For 'Product Safety', there is only one metric, which is quantitative ('Total amount of monetary losses...'). The question specifically asks for topics that only require discussion and analysis disclosures. 'Fleet Fuel Management' has both quantitative and discussion metrics, so it does not only require discussion.

(Reference: Q1)\n</description>\n<example>\n1. Identify transaction parties: Who produces/sells? Who consumes/buys?\n2. Seller perspective: Direct emissions from generation = Scope 1\n3. Buyer perspective: Indirect emissions from consumption = Scope 2\n4. Verify against protocol standards (e.g., GHG Protocol Corporate Standard)\n</极速赛车example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 1\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nAlgebraic problem-solving approach for emission factor calculations. For problems involving EFC and EFG: 1) Write the formula EFC = EFG × (1 + (T&D Losses / Electricity Consumed)), 2) Substitute known values, 3) Solve for the unknown variable, 4) Convert to percentage if needed. (Reference: Q2, Q11)\n</description>\n<example>\n1. Write equation: EFC = EFG × (1 + x) where x = T&D Losses/Electricity Consumed\n2. Substitute given EFC and极速赛车 EFG values\n3. Solve for x: x = (EFC/EFG) - 1\n4. Convert x to percentage: Percentage = x × 100%\nFor direct EFC calculation: Use given consumption and loss values directly\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 2\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nInformation extraction strategy for corporate sustainability reports. When asked to identify specific business units or initiatives from ESG reports: 1) Locate the relevant section (often sustainability or emissions reduction), 2) Look for bulleted lists or explicitly named initiatives, 3) Extract the exact phrasing used in the report, 4) Present in requested format (e.g., list format). (Reference: Q3)\n</description>\n<example>\n1. Identify the report section discussing GHG reduction initiatives\n2. Scan for lists or enumerated business units/initiatives\n3. Copy the exact names as they appear in the document\n4. Format as requested (e.g., [\"item1\", \"item2\", \"item3\"])\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 1\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nCritical assessment of question answerability. Before attempting to solve a problem, evaluate whether all necessary information is available in the provided context. If key data is missing that prevents calculation or conclusion, identify the question as unanswerable rather than making assumptions. This includes missing numerical values, temporal information, categorical details, or specific metrics required for accurate responses. (Reference: Q5, Q6, Q9, Q10)\n</description>\n<example>\n1. Identify what information is needed to answer the question\n2. Check if all required data is present in the context\n3. If any critical piece is missing (numerical, temporal, categorical), conclude \"Not answerable\"\n4. Specify what information is lacking that prevents answering\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 4\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTable analysis methodology for disclosure requirements. When analyzing tables of disclosure topics: 1) Systematically examine each row/topic, 2) Categorize metric types (quantitative vs. discussion/analysis), 3) Apply logical filters based on question criteria, 4) Document findings with evidence from the table. (Reference: Q6)\n</description>\n<example>\n1. Review all disclosure topics\n2. For each topic, identify metric types present\n3. Apply question filter (e.g., \"only discussion/analysis requirements\")\n4. Report results: Either list matching topics or state none exist\n5. Provide evidence from table to support conclusion\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 1\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nExplicit counting strategy for document analysis. When asked to count specific items mentioned in a document: 1) Scan the relevant sections for explicit mentions of the items, 2) Identify distinct types or categories, 3) Count only explicitly stated variations, 4) Avoid inferring additional types not directly mentioned. (Reference: Q7)\n</description>\n<example>\n1. Search for key phrases related to the items being counted\n2. Note each distinct type explicitly described\n3. Count the number of unique types mentioned\n4. Present the count as the final answer\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 1\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nDirect extraction of numerical data from ESG reports. When questions ask for specific percentages or numerical values mentioned in the report: 1) Locate the exact sentence containing the number, 2) Extract the numerical value precisely as stated, 3) Format as requested (e.g., with percentage symbol or decimal places). (Reference: Q8, Q12)\n</description>\n<example>\n1. Identify the section relevant to the question topic\n2. Search for numerical values or percentages in that section\n3. Extract the exact number mentioned in the text\n4. Present it as the answer without modification\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 2\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nUnit conversion strategy for emission factor calculations. When working with emission factors and energy consumption data: 1) Ensure all values are in consistent units before calculation, 2) Convert between MWh and kWh as needed (1 MWh = 1000 kWh), 3) Maintain proper decimal precision throughout calculations. (Reference: Q11)\n</description>\n<example>\n1. Identify unit inconsistencies: EFG in tCO2e/MWh vs. consumption in kWh\n2. Convert EFG: tCO2e/MWh ÷ 1000 = tCO2e/kWh\n3. Perform calculations with consistent units\n4. Convert final result back to desired units if needed\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 1\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nMulti-source verification for numerical data extraction. When extracting numerical values from reports, verify consistency across multiple mentions in the document to ensure accuracy. If the same value appears in multiple locations, it confirms reliability. (Reference: Q12)\n</description>\n<example>\nFor Google's 2023 PUE value:\n- Page 14: \"average annual PUE...was 1.10\"\n- Page 34: \"average annual PUE...was 1.10\" \n- Page 79: \"fleet-wide PUE: 1.10\"\nMultiple consistent mentions confirm the value is 1.10 (or 1.1)\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 1"
