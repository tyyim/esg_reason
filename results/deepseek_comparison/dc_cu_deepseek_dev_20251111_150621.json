When extracting the four pillars of TNFD's recommended disclosure framework, recognize that while context may only partially show the structure, the standard TNFD framework consists of four core pillars that organize the 14 recommended disclosures. Extract all four pillars based on standard framework knowledge when context is incomplete. (Reference: Q22)\n</description>\n<example>\nFor TNFD framework pillars:\n- Context shows Figure 1 with \"Governance\" as first pillar\n- Standard TNFD framework includes: Governance, Strategy, Risk & Impact Management, Metrics & Targets\n- Extract all four pillars even if context only partially enumerates them\n- Return as comma-separated list in standard order\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 1\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nChange log analysis strategy.

(Reference: Q29)\n</description>\n<example>\nFor oil sands mining tailings facility reporting:\n- Scan pages with high relevance scores (Page 155: 0.767, 0.750)\n- Look for \"additional sector disclosures\" sections specifically for oil sands mining operations\n- Extract the complete reporting framework: list all facilities; for each: describe, report status, report risk assessment details; describe impact management actions极\n- This represents specialized reporting requirements beyond general waste management disclosures\n</极\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 1\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nIrrelevant content analysis strategy. When context contains only general corporate initiatives without specific environmental metrics or sustainability data, systematically scan all pages to confirm the absence of relevant information before returning 'null'. This ensures accurate null responses when the requested data is genuinely not available in the provided context. (Reference: Q30)\n</description>\n<example>\nFor Google plastic recycling percentage:\n- Scan all context pages (Pages 13, 14, 7, 8, 9)\n- Confirm absence of plastic-related terms, recycling percentages, or consumer hardware sustainability metrics\n- Note that context contains only general Google initiatives (Accessibility, Crisis response, Digital wellbeing, etc.)\n- Return: null (information not in context)\n- Avoid speculation or estimation from unrelated content\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 1",
