However, the context does not specify whether Organization C or D falls under this category. If Organization C is responsible for the generation and transmission of electricity, then the emissions associated with T&D losses would not be reported under Scope 2, as they would already be accounted for under Scope 1. On the other hand, if Organization D owns or controls the T&D system, then the emissions associated with T&D losses would be reported under Scope 2.\n\n2. **Scope 2 Reporting**: Scope 2 only accounts for the portion of the direct emissions from generating electricity that is actually consumed by the organization. In this scenario, since Organization D is an end user consuming the purchased electricity, the emissions associated with the 95 MWh of electricity it buys from Organization C would be reported under Scope 2. This is because the emissions are considered indirect and occur at the point of generation, which is outside the organizational boundary of Organization D.\n\n3. **Scope 3 Reporting**: Upstream T&D losses are accounted for in Scope 3. Since Organization C consumes 5 MWh and sells the rest to Organization D, the emissions related to these upstream T&D losses would be included in Scope 3 reporting for Organization C, and possibly in Scope 3 for Organization D depending on the nature of their operations.\n\n4. **Optional Information**: Company B reports emissions from the purchased electricity sold to a non-end user as optional information. This suggests that while not mandatory, organizations can choose to report such emissions, but they are typically not included in Scope 2.\n\nIn summary, the electricity sold from Organization C to Organization D would be reported under Scope 2 for Organization D, and potentially under Scope 3 for Organization C, depending on the ownership and control of the T&D system.

According to the context, EFG represents the emissions attributable to electricity consumed during end use only, while EFC accounts for the emissions during end use and transmission and distribution. The difference between EFC and EFG gives us the emissions due to T&D losses, which can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{T&D Losses} = \\text{EFC} \\times \\text{Electricity Consumed} - \\text{EFG} \\times \\text{Electricity Consumed} \\]\n\nGiven the EFC and EFG values:\n- EFC = 0.66 kg CO\u2082/kWh\n- EFG = 0.6 kg CO\u2082/kWh\n\nWe can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{T&D Losses} = 0.66 \\times \\text{Electricity Consumed} - 0.6 \\times \\text{Electricity Consumed} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\text{T&D Losses} = (0.66 - 0.6) \\times \\text{Electricity Consumed} \\]\n\\[ \\text{T&D Losses} = 0.06 \\times \\text{Electricity Consumed} \\]\n\nTo find the percentage of T&D losses over the electricity consumed, we divide the T&D losses by the electricity consumed and multiply by 100:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of T&D Losses} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{T&D Losses}}{\\text{Electricity Consumed}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of T&D Losses} = \\left( \\frac{0.06 \\times \\text{Electricity Consumed}}{\\text{Electricity Consumed}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of T&D Losses} = 0.06 \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of T&D Losses} = 6\\% \\]\n\nHowever, this result assumes that the amount of electricity consumed is known, which it is not in the provided context.

        "analysis": "Based on the context, the potential risks and impacts of enhanced weathering (EW) include:\n\n1. **Mining Impacts**: There are local impacts associated with the mining process for rocks used in EW, similar to those of mining mineral construction aggregates. This includes environmental disturbances at the mining site and potential changes in landscape and ecosystems.\n\n2. **Air Quality Impacts**: Spreading rock dust on soil during EW can affect air quality. The dust particles might contribute to particulate matter in the air, which can have adverse effects on human health and the environment.\n\n3. **Role in Mitigation Pathways**: While EW shows promise in terms of CO2 removal, its integration into broader climate mitigation strategies is limited. Currently, only one study has incorporated EW into integrated assessment models to explore its role in climate change mitigation.\n\n4. **Potential of CO2 Removal**: Studies such as Beerling et al. (2020) and Fuss et al. (2018) provide estimates for the potential of CO2 removal by EW in the future. Beerling et al. suggest that up to 2 GtCO2 yr\u20131 could be removed by 2050 if 35-59% of agricultural land in 12 countries is used, while Fuss et al. provide a wider range of 2-4 GtCO2 yr\u20131 for 2050.\n\n5. **Co-benefits and Trade-offs**: EW can offer co-benefits such as enhanced plant growth due to pH modification and increased mineral supply, improved soil condition stability (SCS) in certain soils, protection against soil erosion, and increased cation exchange capacity leading to better nutrient retention and availability. However, there are also trade-offs and potential negative impacts, including the reduction of net carbon dioxide removal by up to 30% due to the energy required for the process.\n\nGiven the information, the primary risks and impacts of enhanced weathering revolve around the local environmental effects of mining and the potential air quality issues caused by spreading rock dust on agricultural lands.
