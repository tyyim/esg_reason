If an organization owns or controls the T&D system, the emissions associated with T&D losses are reported under scope 2. In this case, if Organization C consumes 5 MWh of electricity and sells the remaining 95 MWh to Organization D, the emissions from the 95 MWh sold to Organization D would be reported under scope 2 by Organization C. This is because Organization D is an end user and does not own or control the T&D system.\n\nReference: Q1\n</description>\n<example>\nOrganization C:\n- Consumes: 5 MWh\n- Sells: 95 MWh to Organization D\n\nOrganization D:\n- Does not own or control T&D system\n- Reports Scope 2 for the 95 MWh purchased from Organization C\n\nScope 2 Reporting:\n- Organization C reports the emissions from the 95 MWh sold to Organization D under scope 2.\n- Organization D reports the emissions from the 95 MWh consumed under scope 2.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nGiven two emission factors, EFC (Electricity from Consumption) and EFG (Electricity from Generation), the percentage of T&D loss over electricity consumed can be calculated using the following steps:\n1. Determine the total electricity consumed by the organization.\n2. Calculate the T&D loss using the difference between EFG and EFC.\n3. Compute the percentage of T&D loss relative to the total electricity consumed.\n\nThe formula to calculate the percentage of T&D loss is:\n\\[ \\text{T&D Loss Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{EFG} - \\text{EFC}}{\\text{EFG}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFor example, if an organization has an EFC of 0.66 kg CO₂/kWh and an EFG of 0.6 kg CO₂/kWh, the T&D loss percentage can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{T&D Loss Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{0.6 - 0.66}{0.66} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx -9.09\\% \\]\n\nHowever, a negative percentage indicates an error in the given values, as T&D losses should result in a positive percentage increase in emissions. Therefore, ensure that the EFG value is greater than the EFC value before performing the calculation.\n</description>\n<example>\nGiven:\n- EFC = 0.66 kg CO₂/kWh\n- EFG = 0.6 kg CO₂/kWh\n\nCalculate T&D Loss Percentage:\n\\[ \\text{T&D Loss Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{0.6 - 0.66}{0.66} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx -9.09\\% \\]\n\nSince a negative percentage is not physically meaningful in this context, it suggests that the EFG value might be incorrect or the values need to be reassessed.\n</example>\n** Count: 2\n</memory_item>\n\n<description>\nIf the EFG value is indeed higher than the EFC value, the calculation would be:\n\\[ \\text{T&D Loss Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{0.66 - 0.6}{0.6} \\right) \\times 100 = 10\\% \\]\n\nThis means that the T&D losses contribute an additional 10% to the total emissions compared to the electricity generated.\n</description>\n<example>\nGiven:\n- EFC = 0.66 kg CO₂/kWh\n- EFG = 0.7 kg CO₂/kWh\n\nCalculate T&D Loss Percentage:\n\\[ \\text{T&D Loss Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{0.7 - 0.66}{0.66} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 6.06\\% \\]\n\nIn this scenario, the T&D losses contribute approximately 6.06% to the total emissions.\n</example>\n** Count: 3\n</memory_item>\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nIf the EFG value is lower than the EFC value, it indicates that the organization is likely overestimating its emissions due to incorrect data or misinterpretation. In such cases, the T&D loss percentage should be recalculated with the correct values.\n</description>\n<example>\nGiven:\n- EFC = 0.66 kg CO₂/kWh\n- EFG = 0.55 kg CO₂/kWh\n\nCalculate T&D Loss Percentage:\n\\[ \\text{T&D Loss Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{0.66 - 0.55}{0.55} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 20\\% \\]\n\nHere, the T&D losses contribute approximately 20% to the total emissions.\n</example>\n** Count: 4\n</memory_item>\n\n[memory_item]\n[...]\n[/memory_item]\n\n[...]\n\n[memory_item]\n[...]\n[/memory_item]\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## GENERAL META-REASONING STRATEGIES\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTo accurately account for electricity sales in Scope 1 and 2 reporting, it is crucial to distinguish between the ownership and control of the T&D system.

Given EFG = 0.5 tCO2e/MWh, electricity consumed = 10,000 kWh, and T&D losses = 1,000 kWh, we can substitute these values into the formula. First, convert kWh to MWh: 10,000 kWh = 10 MWh and 1,000 kWh = 1 MWh. Then, calculate EFC: EFC = 0.5 x (1 + 1/10) = 0.5 x 1.1 = 0.55 tCO2e/MWh.\n\n** Final Answer: 0.55 tCO2e/MWh\n\n-----\n-----\n\n## Updated Previous Cheatsheet\n\nVersion: 1.8\n\nSOLUTIONS, IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS, AND CODE SNIPPETS\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTo determine the survey completion date, look for explicit mentions or references within the document.

These chemicals can persist for months or even years and can be re-emitted into the air, leading to prolonged exposure and potential health hazards. Thirdhand smoke is particularly concerning for children and non-smokers who may be exposed to these harmful substances without being aware of the risks.\n</description>\n<example>\nThirdhand smoke is a significant health risk due to its persistence and re-emission properties. Here’s how it differs from secondhand smoke:\n\n1. **Persistence of Residual Chemicals**: Secondhand smoke is the smoke exhaled by smokers and smoke from burning cigarettes, which dissipates quickly. In contrast, thirdhand smoke consists of residual chemicals that remain on surfaces such as walls, furniture, and clothing after smoking. These chemicals can persist for months or even years.\n2. **Re-Emission into the Air**: Thirdhand smoke can be re-emitted into the air through processes like desorption, leading to ongoing exposure. This re-emission can occur even when there is no active smoking present.\n3. **Health Hazards**: Thirdhand smoke exposure can lead to various health issues, including respiratory problems, allergies, and increased risk of cancer. It is especially dangerous for children and non-smokers who may be unaware of the risks and unable to avoid exposure.\n\nTo understand the differences between thirdhand and secondhand smoke, consider the following points:\n- **Persistence**: Thirdhand smoke chemicals can linger on surfaces, whereas secondhand smoke dissipates quickly.\n- **Re-Emission**: Thirdhand smoke can be re-emitted into the air, leading to continuous exposure.\n- **Health Risks**: Thirdhand smoke poses unique health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations like children and non-smokers.\n\nFor example, if a room has been used by a smoker, the residual chemicals can remain on the walls, carpets, and furniture. Even after the smoker leaves, these chemicals can continue to be released into the air, exposing others to potential health hazards.\n</example>\n** Count: 1\n</memory_item>\n\n[...]\n\n```\n\nThis updated cheatsheet now includes a new section on health risks and thirdhand smoke, providing a detailed explanation of how thirdhand smoke differs from secondhand smoke in terms of health risks.

Here’s how it differs from secondhand smoke:\n\n1. **Persistence of Residual Chemicals**: Secondhand smoke is the smoke exhaled by smokers and smoke from burning cigarettes, which dissipates quickly. In contrast, thirdhand smoke consists of residual chemicals that remain on surfaces such as walls, furniture, and clothing after smoking. These chemicals can persist for months or even years.\n2. **Re-Emission into the Air**: Thirdhand smoke can be re-emitted into the air through processes like desorption, leading to ongoing exposure. This re-emission can occur even when there is no active smoking present.\n3. **Health Hazards**: Thirdhand smoke exposure can lead to various health issues, including respiratory problems, allergies, and increased risk of cancer. It is especially dangerous for children and non-smokers who may be unaware of the risks and unable to avoid exposure.\n\nTo understand the differences between thirdhand and secondhand smoke, consider the following points:\n- **Persistence**: Thirdhand smoke chemicals can linger on surfaces, whereas secondhand smoke dissipates quickly.\n- **Re-Emission**: Thirdhand smoke can be re-emitted into the air, leading to continuous exposure.\n- **Health Risks**: Thirdhand smoke poses unique health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations like children and non-smokers.\n\nFor example, if a room has been used by a smoker, the residual chemicals can remain on the walls, carpets, and furniture.
