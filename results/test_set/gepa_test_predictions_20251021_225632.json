The context mentions that if the annual CO\u2082 emissions between 2020\u20132030 stayed at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5\u00b0C (50%). This implies that the emissions from 2020 to 2030 would be close to the remaining budget of 500 GtCO\u2082. Given that 2019 emissions are assumed to be part of this budget, we can estimate the average annual emissions for this period and use it to approximate the maximum average annual emissions for 2020 to 2050.\n\nSince there are 11 years from 2020 to 2030, the total emissions from 2020 to 2030 would be approximately 500 GtCO\u2082. To find the average annual emissions, we divide this total by 11. The remaining period from 2030 to 2050 is 20 years, and we assume the emissions remain constant at the 2019 level during this period. Therefore, the maximum average annual CO\u2082 emissions for the entire period from 2020 to 2050 can be calculated by dividing the remaining carbon budget by the total number of years (30 years).\n\n\\[ \\text{Average annual emissions} = \\frac{\\text{Remaining carbon budget}}{\\text{Total number of years}} = \\frac{500 \\text{ GtCO}_2}{11 \\text{ years}} \\approx 45.45 \\text{ GtCO}_2/\\text{year} \\]\n\nHowever, since we need to find the maximum average annual CO\u2082 emission allowed for the period 2020 to 2050 to stay within the remaining carbon budget, we should consider the remaining 20 years after 2030. Thus, the correct calculation is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Maximum average annual emissions for 2020-2050} = \\frac{500 \\text{ GtCO}_2}{20 \\text{ years}} = 25 \\text{ GtCO}_2/\\text{year} \\]\n\nGiven that the total remaining carbon budget for 1.5\u00b0C (50% likelihood) is 500 GtCO\u2082 and the period considered is 20 years, the maximum average annual CO\u2082 emissions allowed would be 25 GtCO\u2082/year.",
